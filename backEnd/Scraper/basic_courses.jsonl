Truth-teller, seducer, agitator, subversive? Prophet, memory-keeper, wordsmith of love? A freak who makes language go haywire? A genius who turns citizens into thriving humans? In this class, we'll dive headlong into this question, reading lots of poetry and lots of manifestos, vision-statements, and other poetry-should-do-type documents which poets wrote to orient their quest. We'll explore many trajectories together: poetry about freedom and the inner voice, about loss and memory, about social recognition and political struggle, about psychic energetics in language, about religion and reality and so much else... Students will be encouraged to chart their own course in this class. After wrestling with Plato's banishment of the poets from his Republic, for the midterm we'll each pick one poet and explicate their vision of poetry. For the final essay, we'll define the role of the poet in society for ourselves, whatever vision matters most to you. Along the way, we'll engage blogposts, interviews, and other texts from contemporary writers debating relevant topics. Students will also develop verbal reading skills through one oral performance of a poem and a final presentation sharing your research with the class. Don't worry if you don't know much about poetry yet a healthy curiosity is all that's asked. Lessons will develop the terms, tools, reading strategies and historical perspectives needed to engage these exciting and thought-provoking works. We'll trade quantity of reading for attention to the readings. Skills worksheets accompanying the readings will focus on issues like metaphor, paraphrase, rhetorical appeal, tone and flow, then later on researching, drafting, and finalizing our own written work. As a poet myself who has thought about these topics for years, I look forward to helping you produce your best work, writing a lot and thinking great thoughts. Books: Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet (trans. Stephen Mitchell) Walt Whitman, The Portable Walt Whitman Emily Dickinson, Final Harvest We will only read excerpts from the Whitman and Dickinson collections, but it is still good to have them at hand for mind-wandering purposes. As the class aims to survey many poetic voices and theories, we'll also read individual poems from writers such as: Sylvia Plath, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, Adrienne Rich, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Audre Lourde, W. B. Yeats, John Ashbery, W. H. Auden, E. E.

With a more specific turn toward art today, the aesthetic allows us to ask an important question: what does it mean to judge an object and to call it beautiful? In \"The Aesthetic, Vol. 1,\" we will trace the genealogy of aesthetics from its use as an appeal to life and perception in the history of philosophy, to popular culture, where to `like' someone's aesthetic, to `have' aura, and to `serve,' have become signature expressions of the contemporary use of aesthetic-related terminology. The course will begin with a general understanding of aesthetics specifically, aisthesis, beauty, and taste-- and will aim toward the presence of dreams and phantasy in the psychoanalysis of race, the nature and culture divide in sex/gender discourse, and the turn to the body in literary and art criticism. The texts of focus will be chosen from philosophers, such as, Georges Bataille, Immanuel Kant, Simon Gikandi, J. Gottfried Herder, David Marriott, Jean-Paul Sartre, and others. These philosophers will allow us to approach the field of aesthetics with some conceptual grasp and language to read objects in literature, film-cinema, contemporary and installation art, experimental media, music, and poetry. Thus, several of these objects will belong to writers, poets and artists, such as, Alexander Calder, Le Corbusier, Med Hondo, Eugene Hyde, Abdelkébir Khatibi, Thierry Kuntzel, Adolf Loos, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney, and others to be decided upon throughout the course. Required Assignments: Over the course of the semester, students will complete three one-page reading responses, one one-page piece of art criticism, upload collaborative annotations, and one final paper. Required Texts: All required and optional materials will be provided by the instructor. While we will not have the time to use some of the materials in their entirety, students are encouraged to utilize the online and physical copies of the following texts through Emory Libraries: George Bataille, Encyclopedædia Acephalica. David Marriott, On Black Men. Abdelkébir Khatibi, Love in Two Languages."}

Besides literature and media, students will also engage with critical theories on race, childhood studies, and media representation. We will explore key questions such as: (i) how do Black authors and creators redefine childhood? (ii) in what ways do systemic forces shape the experiences of Black youth in fiction and reality? (iii) how do storytelling and visual media contribute to broader discourses on race and justice? Readings may include works by Brazilian and American authors such as Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Conceição Evaristo, and Eliana Alves Cruz, alongside films, television series, and social media content that center Black youth. Students will work on the topics of discussion through small writing assignments, reading responses, student-led discussion, a short research paper, and a creative project at the end of the semester."}

Instead, adopting a global perspective, we will discuss how \"modernist\" texts respond to and register shared foundational forces such as modernization as a historical phenomenon, global wars, nation-state makings, colonialism, and race, while tracing how such shared concerns and issues generate varying modernist projects and expressions. To deepen our understanding of how \"modernist\" authors engaged with global conditions, we will compare a set of novels from different parts of the world across temporal, political, and linguistic lines and establish connections between them in discussion and writing. Even as we study just a few texts, our aim is to gather a sense of these diverse yet interconnected literary movements around the globe and of the globalizing conditions that provoked them. In privileging a geopoetical perspective (which looks at geopolitical forces as well as formal variations), this course aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how modernity is experienced differently across the globe and to encourage students to analyze global modernisms in a comparative framework.) Readings include Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Ahmed Hamdi Tanpinar's The Time Regulation Institute, Alejo Carpentier's The Kingdom of This World, and Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things."}

The classical tragic figure could be either male or female, but the Renaissance ushers in new gender roles and modes of viewing that significantly alter this paradigm. In this class, we will explore the causes and effects of female subjectivity, agency, and sexuality beginning with Sophocles Antigone in 441 BCE and until the publication of Valeria Maini's lesbian-centered heroine, Celinda, published in 1611 CE. We will also focus on numerous theoretical texts that deal with the aesthetics of tragedy, all authored by men, to see how tragedy became a vehicle to challenge and question prevailing civic structures through the gendered lens of writing the tragic, female experience.

And it addresses various conceptualizations of scale and scaling as a way of exploring the myriad relations and connections established between texts and communities in world literature. Scales that run from granular, local, minor, or regional frameworks to macro analyses like world-systems, connected histories, deep time, planetarity, and/or the digital humanities. As we engage with the question of scale, we'll take up important discussions in the field, like how well literature travels and on what basis, the many modes of text and textuality, the ethical implications of close versus distant reading practices, the risks of comparison, the significance of interpretative communities, the dialectic between literature and history, the problem of linguistic difference, and what is lost or gained in translation. Some of our primary readings, subject to change, include J.M. Coetzee, Diary of A Bad Year, Sabahattin Ali's Madonna in a Fur Coat, Hamid Ismailov's Gaia, Queen of Ants, and Amitav Ghosh's In An Antique Land."}

Students will learn about the structure and functioning of the system as well as its foundational values and principles. They will also be introduced to public health systems in Canada, Haiti, Senegal, and other French-speaking countries for a comparative perspective. The specificities of public health for women, the LGBTQ community, and racial and ethnic minorities will also be addressed. Students will be encouraged to ask whose health is taken the most seriously and which illnesses are given the most attention and why. Texts studied include academic studies, novels, films, and articles and videos from the popular press."}

FREN 351 (E. Darzi / MW 2:30-3:45pm) There is No Place Like Home Content: Amid a global migration crisis, hundreds of thousands seek refuge, either fleeing war or violence, escaping political oppression, persecution, or discrimination due to race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or a membership in a social group, or looking for a better future because of humanitarian crises, environmental disasters caused by climate change or financial insecurity and economic hardship. At the same time, nationalism, populism, and racism are on the rise, defining and restricting, ever more firmly, the borders of countries and the laws of citizenship. But all seem to be saying, at once: \"I want a home!\"But what is a home? Where is a home? When are you home? Who is home? How can one speak of a home? In this course, we will explore the question of the home in major 19th and 20th century Francophone and French texts as well as films and contemporary works of art. Through multiple disciplines including literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, sculpture, painting, photography, video art, architecture, and film, we will go in and out of (conceptions of) the home. Instead of looking to build a monumental and monolithic home, this course will seek to examine the multiple, and, perhaps, infinite meanings this word can bear through its close relations to concepts such as family, space, individuality, consciousness, immigration, refuge, asylum, comfort, language, and memory. Class assignments will emphasize this multidisciplinary approach: assignments will include creative writing, co-curating an online exhibition, a midterm essay devoted to a close reading of a text or artwork, a group presentation, and a comparative final paper."}

Rather than viewing Greek art in isolation, this course examines it as a trans-Mediterranean phenomenon, shaped by dialogue, mutual artistic influence, and economic exchange with the millenary cultures of the Near East. Students will not only learn about cultural centers like Athens and canonical works of art and architecture but also explore the artistic productions of the wider ancient Greek diaspora, attested from the Iberian Peninsula to modern-day Afghanistan.)"}

Indeed, Roman art has often been characterized as the first truly modern art. The course will investigate the ways in which major achievements in sculpture, painting, numismatic and glyptic art, as well as architecture often reflected contemporary developments in Roman politics, society and religion. In addition the course will explore the relationship of works of art and architecture erected in the city of Rome to those in the provinces, the interaction of public and official art to domestic art, as well as the impact of art commissioned by imperial and elite patrons on that commissioned by non-elite patrons.

Through a systematic analysis of sites, buildings, monuments, and various artistic media, it explores how Greek architectural and visual forms have been appropriated, adapted, and contested over time. Topics include the influence of Greek architecture on public and private buildings and memorials; its association with white supremacy, particularly in the case of Nashville's Parthenon; the intersection of race and Neoclassical sculpture; and the role of Greek sculpture in American visual culture, from queer countercultures to 20th-century advertising and contemporary art.)"}

The classical tragic figure could be either male or female, but the Renaissance ushers in new gender roles and modes of viewing that significantly alter this paradigm. In this class, we will explore the causes and effects of female subjectivity, agency, and sexuality beginning with Sophocles Antigone in 441 BCE and until the publication of Valeria Maini's lesbian-centered heroine, Celinda, published in 1611 CE. We will also focus on numerous theoretical texts that deal with the aesthetics of tragedy, all authored by men, to see how tragedy became a vehicle to challenge and question prevailing civic structures through the gendered lens of writing the tragic, female experience. Texts to be read may include a selection: Sophocles - Antigone Euripides - Alcestis Euripedes - Medea Seneca -Thyestes Gian Giorgio Trissino - Sofonisba Giambattista Giraldi Cinzio - Orbecche Sperone Speroni - Canace Torquato Tasso - Aminta and Re Torrismondo Aristotle - Poetics Horace - Ars Poetica Salvatore Di Maria - The Italian Tragedy in the Renaissance Freud - The Interpretation of Dreams and Beyond the Pleasure Principle Lacan - Seminar VII: The Ethics of Psychoanalysis)"}

During the course, we will cover problems and issues relevant to Emory students, evidence-based approaches to health and wellness, and information on the resources and tools available at Emory for all students. Though designed to prepare students to facilitate and present to freshmen in Health 100, not all students who successfully complete this course will go on to do so. This course will benefit any student with an interest in health who also has the aim of broader intellectual development. This is an online course. Emory College Online summer courses have required synchronous/live sessions every week. Students must be available to sign into and virtually attend the course online during those times (noted as the course meeting times- all times listed are local to Atlanta). Each course will also involve significant asynchronous material that you access on your own time in addition to standard amounts of readings and course assignments. Students should plan to spend 15-20 hours/week on this course. Please also be aware that faculty will begin corresponding with students during Week Zero of the course (one week before the official start date of the course), and that some interaction with the course may be required at that time. Students should begin checking the Canvas course site regularly one week prior to the official start of the term."}

The course will concentrate on key global health players over the last 25 years including public, multilateral, private and philanthropic players. The landscape of global health was framed by the post-World War 2 set of organizations and institutions. Over the last 25 years and particularly since the millennium the landscape has fundamentally changed. This course will explore the dynamics of this change, the influence of respective global health players in crafting the global health agenda and the relative power of each player over time. A key focus of this course will interrogate the question of whether and how the priorities and politics of the big global health players influence decisions taken at community, sub-national and national levels in low and middle income countries. The course will require a significant amount of reading, critique, discussion and analysis. (HLTH 250 is a Prerequisite for this course)"}

This seminar focuses on how residents of Latin America understand health in their everyday lives. We will examine continuities and changes in approaches to healing, health, and disease over time by asking a series of related questions: How have patients and health professionals discussed disease, care, and cure? How have gender, ethnicity, citizenship status, and race shaped public health policies? In what ways did popular health practices figure into everyday life and national programs? How have global organizations engaged with everyday health through eradication and education programs? Students will investigate diverse actors through written, visual, and oral sources and will use primary documents and secondary material to analyze and construct arguments for their final research paper. Although our focus is on Latin America, the processes we will study were and are global in scope."}

We start with a simple premise; the way we take care of ourselves is political. Whether we realize it or not, many of us engage with religion in our daily lives. If you have seen Star Wars, used a yoga mat or meditation app, or attended a Burning Man festival, you have encountered religion. What does it mean when aspects of a religious tradition are transformed into consumer products? What cultural, ethical, and personal dilemmas emerge when religious ideas and objects are used for self-care separate from their religious context? Who decides which religions to borrow from, and which parts of those religions are 'extractible'? How do we approach practices like mindfulness, which have been scientifically proven to have health benefits, but are also sometimes viewed as a forms of cultural appropriation? Who can afford to participate in a consumerist wellness culture? Are there anti-capitalist forms of self-care? Can we imagine what our lives would look like if our society prioritized rest? These are all questions we will consider in this class. Students will have the opportunity to critically examine and experientially engage with contemporary self-care and wellness practices. This is a LINC class. During three of our sessions, we have discussions and practice self-care activities with Dr. Elaine Johnson's PSYC 190 Psychology of Wellbeing class.)"}

Questions students will be asked to consider include, but are not limited to: when does modernity in South Asia begin? How do we narrate the violence of Partition? What are some of the ongoing legacies of British colonialism? And how have historians attempted to recover the voices of South Asia's most marginalized? Reading assignments will introduce students to the \"classic\" works of South Asian history but will also feature the work of younger historians whose recent scholarship has enlivened old debates. Students will also work with a variety of media as part of their introduction to South Asian history. Aside from secondary literature, students will engage with novels, autobiography, and Bollywood film. While this course will only scratch the surface of South Asia's modern history, it aims to offer students a sense of the multiple ways in which to narrate South Asia's past."}

Yet the first struggles of this century-long conflict took place in the period of British rule lasting from 1917-1948. This course examines the history of British rule in Palestine, looking at the rise of Zionism and early Jewish settlement in the land, the formation of a distinctly Palestinian national identity amidst the rise of Arab nationalist movements, and the impact colonial rule had on both peoples. In what ways did this colonial experience shape Arab and Jewish identity in the Holy Land? What did the British Empire hope to achieve in Palestine, both strategically and for their colonial subjects?"}

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research) (This is not an introductory course on the conflict.

That truth is then brought to an audience to react, decide, reflect, and revolt. Plays are a singular democratic practice and gift in the human experience. Every single one of us has brilliant plays inside us, stories that connect others and help people feel alive, but how do we tell them? How do you figure out and access your truth - but more importantly, how can you make your truth legible to the outside world? In Intermediate Playwriting, we will be learning various elements of the craft, voyaging over a century worth of American playwrights to learn different tools and techniques, but more importantly for you to access what excites you and what themes you'd like your work to be in conversation with. In breaking down literary texts and exploring theatrical history, I often pose the central questions: What makes a play a play? What is theatricality? By investigating the foundations of story and identifying the elements that make a text theatrical, students develop a deeper understanding of both the craft and the medium. We will do this over a series of multiple exercises, and you will write a one-act play."}

Because data are information given order, we will consider their arrangement and re-arrangement as rhetoric. We will introduce rhetorical analysis as a model for understanding how quantitative data can be interpreted and conveyed for multiple audiences that range from professional researchers to the lay public. Guided by this knowledge, you will exercise strategies for communicating via the text, speech, and visual conventions that are integral to preparing \"technical\" genres such as research reports, research translations, informative and persuasive infographics, instructions, and data repositories.

This class will take you through a century of canonical African American writers exploring Black desire, from Race Men and Club Women extolling the virtues of racial uplift to satirists gleefully calling attention to our very human foibles, and all those in between, puzzling over the complexity of being both human and symbol, hero and villain in the world's imagination. Through mini-lectures, small group analysis and full class discussions, we will take on the provocative yet rewarding challenges these essays and novels bequeath to us. To what degree does our social identity as African American restrict, mediate or perhaps heighten our desires? When our safety, livelihoods, and dignity are always under assault, how do our desires protect us or expose us further?

The romantic era roughly from the 1780's through the 1830's--was a time of highly charged debates about the role of literature in an increasingly modern society; the texts we will read explore different ways in which key writers of the time addressed the role of literature amidst the pressures of both economic and political upheaval. We will consider how these debates transformed the very language of literature and who and what counted as literary subjects. Figures an earlier literature might not have recognized as having a place in a supposedly elevated literary discourse enter romantic literature both as objects of representation and as the subjects of their own self-representation.

In our society, however, what is recorded is determined by the values of the person doing the recording, resulting in the absence of anyone who is not a white man from many written historical records. In the case of enslaved people, for example, we seldom have a written record of what they called themselves, who they loved, and what they believed. Searching through the records of plantations and slave ships, scholar Saidiya Hartman devised a method called critical fabulation to write about the personhood of enslaved people by \"straining against the limits of the archive to write a cultural history of the captive.\" This class will use archives at the Rose Library and other locations to teach students to practice different types of archival methodologies. We will begin by practicing critical fabulation to explore the gaps in written records about enslaved people. We will move on to practices of remembrance within our own families, conducting genealogical research and oral history. We will then explore the Rose Library's abundant collections of archives donated by Black writers, artists, and activists, detailing some of the most intimate details of their lives through diaries, drafts, and correspondence.

An introduction to the Bhagavad-Gita, a Sanskrit philosophical poem and one of the most famous Hindu scriptures. When the warrior Arjuna surveys the field just moments before battle, he begins to second-guess his decision to fight. Is victory worth all the lives about to be lost? Is he prepared to kill his own family and friends fighting on the other side? Won't civil war destroy the norms and bonds of the political community? The Bhagavad-Gita contains the god Krishna's answers to such questions. While Krishna's teaching starts out as a \"tough love\" pep talk, it soon turns into a stunning lecture touching a wide range of philosophical themes, including selfhood, free will, the structure of action, the ground of being, and love. Our primary goal will be to read the Bhagavad-Gita in English translation, closely and in its entirety. Many of the course readings will help us situate the Gita in its various contexts' historical, religio-philosophical (e.g., Vedic ritualism, Vedanta, Sankhya, Yoga), and narrative (the Gita forming one section of a much larger epic). As we work to understand Krishna's complex teaching, we will also make use of the Gita's vast commentarial tradition, consulting traditional commentators such as Shankara, Yamuna, and Ramanuja, as well as modern authors such as M.K. Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and B.R. Ambedkar."}

We will explore three broad areas of the sociological study of mental illness which include definitions and measurement of mental illness; its social origins; and societal processes through Western and decolonial perspectives. By scrutinizing Western (American) ideologies we will be better able to articulate how mental health and illness is a product of social circumstances like interpersonal, institutional, and cultural factors, rather than just the result of biological (or genetic) and individual-level factors. Through a decolonial lens, we will decenter white supremacy and propose solutions to improve mental health by reducing inequality and the impact of colonialism while incorporating culturally-affirming practices from Black and First Nations people. Learning objectives: 1. Explain the social construction of mental illness. 2. Describe the social distribution of mental health and illness. 3. Compare and contrast theoretical approaches to the study of mental health and illness. 4.Critically assess social antecedents and consequences of mental health and illness."}

Students will investigate how sensory perception is culturally mediated, analyzing case studies that demonstrate how societies prioritize different senses and assign varying meanings to sensory experiences. From the acoustic landscapes of Warao ritual music in Venezuela, to the tactile significance of Guatemalan textile traditions, and from the olfactory coding in the Americas social interactions to the gustatory symbolism of Amazonian cooking practices, this course reveals how the senses function as both biological capabilities and cultural constructions.

At the same time, narratives are situated in specific cultural contexts. This course will highlight Spanish-language literature and other forms of storytelling (film, visual and digital texts, journalism) from Spain, Latin America, and the U.S. that are expressions of citizen protest, analyzing how narrative genres and strategies are used to communicate these texts' messages to their audiences. Course texts are drawn from protests associated with environmental activism, indigenous movements, student movements, feminism and gender protests, critiques of economic neoliberalism, pro-democracy movements and defense of human rights. SPAN 311 is one of the foundational courses for the Spanish major and minor. PREREQUISITE: Spanish 212 or an official Spanish placement for a Foundational Course level (Span 300-318).

What expectations might visitors to American or European museums and galleries have about art by an artist specifically identified with the continent of Africa?

Answers to such questions impact where in a museum we might find an artist's work and how a museum might present the work.

We will focus on arts created for worldwide audiences by diverse artists linked to different areas of the African continent.

Class meetings will consist of a combination of lectures and in-class computational exercises. Prerequisites: Biology 142 + 142L. Although the class will be largely self-contained, a working knowledge of introductory calculus, statistics, linear algebra, and some exposure to differential equations will be helpful (although a mathematical review will be provided). Knowing some neuroscience may also be helpful, but it is not required. Although most of the course will be taught in Matlab, only a working knowledge of basic programming control structures (e.g., for/while loops & if/then structures, etc.) is necessary, as we will devote time to coding tutorials at the beginning of the semester.

Students will meet weekly to learn about specialty coffee and collectively support coffee growers from Guatemala and Honduras. In the first four meetings, students will read about and discuss issues related to specialty coffee and storytelling. Then, students will be introduced to participating coffee growers. During each 3-Day Storytelling Workshop, students will work with growers to cultivate a deeper appreciation for how effective farm stories can enhance economic opportunities. In the post-workshop meetings, students will continue to work with their assigned growers to complete, review, and refine their stores. Completed stories will be posted on a dedicated website."}

This shift of landscapes within philosophy and sciences has coincided with the rise of the Anthropocene in the humanities, a sense of environmental urgency, and the exacerbation as well as deformation of anthropocentric systems of thought and world-making. This course is designed to think about plants and with plants and to consider plants as thinking beings. The seminar will bring students from four different perspectives (comparative literature, philosophy, environmental studies, and religion) to encounter intellectual, physical, and emotive experiences with plants. How does one commune with nature by virtue of relating to plants? How do you relate to plants? How do plants think? How do plants feel? How do humans understand, or not, that plants dwell and experience other kinds of bodies and souls? How does life change by knowing and thinking plants? How does one think plants as thinking beings? Do plants care about thinking?)
