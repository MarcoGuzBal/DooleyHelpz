Quite obviously, the reality is considerably more complicated. This class will take you through a century of canonical African American writers exploring Black desire, from Race Men and Club Women extolling the virtues of racial uplift to satirists gleefully calling attention to our very human foibles, and all those in between, puzzling over the complexity of being both human and symbol, hero and villain in the world's imagination. Through mini-lectures, small group analysis and full class discussions, we will take on the provocative yet rewarding challenges these essays and novels bequeath to us. To what degree does our social identity as African American restrict, mediate or perhaps heighten our desires? When our safety, livelihoods, and dignity are always under assault, how do our desires protect us or expose us further? Course work will include 10 written reader reactions, one midterm paper of 1250 words and one final paper of 2500 words. Attendance and participation in discussion also required. (SAME AAS 262W-1)"}

Much of the work on archival theory to date has been in interrogating the role of archives in state formation and in the construction of national histories. This course shifts focus to the materiality of the documents, objects, buildings, and people constitutive of the archive. In what ways are poems and stories entangled with institutions of culture? Why do literary texts take the material forms that they do? How might exploring an author's correspondence, drafts, periodical publications, or limited editions affect how we interpret their work? This course focuses on African and African diaspora, Irish, and postcolonial writers whose literary archives are held in Emory's Stuart A. Rose Library or who have left traces in its collections. Expanding our sense of what constitutes an archive, we will consider the ways in which institutions have the power to privilege and marginalize, as well as preserve and promote. Writers may include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Agha Shahid Ali, Lucille Clifton, Lorna Goodison, Seamus Heaney, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill (in translation), Christopher Okigbo, Natasha Trethewey, and W. B. Yeats. This course, intended for advanced students in English and/or Creative Writing, runs concurrently with a graduate seminar."}

Making People: Empathy and Expertise This is an introductory course on the art of fiction writing. We will focus on elements of craft such as character development, narrative control, dialogue, scene development, setting, structure, openings and endings. We will engage with fiction writing as always about creating human beings with histories, bodies, and social realities; as always about creating a world anew for an audience; and as always a form of communication with an ongoing humanity -- be it dead writers, current beloveds, future anonymous readers or one's own self. Students will come to understand the fiction workshop as a place to face fears, biases and the limitations of the imagination all via practice and hard work. Students will come to see fiction as a place to communicate as writers and critics. Students come to see fiction writing and critical reading as a place to engage bravely and vulnerably with grief, joy and the full range of human emotions between."}

No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. If journalism has historically been considered a pure and ethically-driven form of nonfiction; if, pardon the cliché, it is the first rough draft of history; if its principle motivator in this nation's history has been the pursuit of truth, justice and the American way (you did know Superman/Clark Kent was a newspaper reporter, right?); and if it is the most zealous guardian of not just any amendment to the U.S. Constitution but the First Amendment, then why is the profession of journalism historically misrepresented as crude and corrupt when Hollywood tries to tell its story? Or is the profession's purity just an old former newspaperman's misguided fantasy that confuses vice and virtue in a vocation that consumed him and his conscience for more than 35 years? Newsrooms have long been filled with quiet creative geniuses and loudmouth miscreants, the brilliant and the boorish, the talented and the tawdry, and yet there are few if any professions as tethered to, and as cognizant of, a code of ethics. What does that get you? Good fodder for screenwriters and filmmakers of feature films and documentaries at home and abroad.

Your goal will be to synthesize the work you've done as a writer and learner at Emory - within the minor, and beyond - by curating and showcasing what you consider your best work. As you grapple with how to portray a version of yourself and the commitments you've developed from your experiences, we will take a metadisciplinary and rhetorical approach to this representation. We will reflect on how you have learned to create meaning in your fields and communities, in terms of what you have been taught to value and come to value personally in your scholarship. Moreover, you will practice using writing and speech to show this approach to others who may or may not have the same backgrounds as you do. The course will culminate in an oral \"defense\" of your portfolio, where you will present what you've created to me, your peers, and others in the Writing Program."}

The course introduces the basic steps, methods and strategies of the research process; problem identification, hypothesis development, literature review, research design and methodology, data management, data analysis, and scientific communication. Its aim is to help students design and develop a thoughtful, persuasive, and potentially fundable scientific research proposal that addresses a health concern. Students begin with a broad health topic that they would like to investigate and learn how to narrow it down into a specific and feasible research question; then they learn how to design a methodology to address the question. In addition to comprehending and developing the elements of a research project, students also learn the principles of ethical conduct of research, essentials of scientific writing, as well as presentation skills. Students also learn how to conduct a literature review, how to evaluate the literature, and how to use a reference management software.

The course will concentrate on key global health players over the last 25 years including public, multilateral, private and philanthropic players. The landscape of global health was framed by the post-World War 2 set of organizations and institutions. Over the last 25 years and particularly since the millennium the landscape has fundamentally changed. This course will explore the dynamics of this change, the influence of respective global health players in crafting the global health agenda and the relative power of each player over time. A key focus of this course will interrogate the question of whether and how the priorities and politics of the big global health players influence decisions taken at community, sub-national and national levels in low and middle income countries. The course will require a significant amount of reading, critique, discussion and analysis. (HLTH 250 is a Prerequisite for this course)"}

Part of what makes German Romanticism unique is its blending of the philosophical and the poetic/literary in its quest for a language and form adequate to, or at least resonant with, what it seeks to present: the \"Absolute.\" In this course, we will focus on the themes of system & fragment, romantic irony, the native/foreign opposition, conceptions of the feminine, and the problem of evil, reading Schlegel, Tieck, Hölderlin, Günderrode, Novalis, and Schelling, on the one hand, each supplemented by a reading from Blanchot, De Man, Heidegger, Wolf, Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, and Zizek, respectively, on the other.

In the first section, we will read general accounts of technological experience and technological objects by Martin Heidegger, Gilbert Simondon, and Yuk Hui. In the second, we will turn to the question of human-machine interaction and symbiosis in Plato, Ernst Kapp, Ernst Jünger, and Donna Haraway. In the third section, we will look at the emergence of cybernetics and the philosophy of information in N. Katherine Hayle, Norbet Wiener, and Raymond Ruyer. Finally, we will examine classic and contemporary debates about artificial intelligence and human consciousness in Hubert Dreyfus, Jean-François Lyotard, and several contemporary authors (to be determined).

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research) (This is not an introductory course on the conflict.

Content: With the study of hysteria, Freud discovered the process of repression and elaborated the concept of the unconscious. The unconscious, however, does not rest quietly. It returns to haunt the present through various disruptions that conscious thought does not know how to explain to itself: slips of the tongue, dreams, phobias, anxieties, delusions. If we learn from psychoanalysis that a past that has been repressed can return to disrupt the present, literature, for its part, has its own way of staging these uncanny returns. What comes back under the figures of the ghosts, vampires, and witches that haunt the literary stage? How do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget? These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature, psychoanalysis and film.

He was deeply steeped both in the Greco-Islamic philosophical tradition (i.e., Plato and Aristotle via writers like Alfarabi, Avicenna and Al-Ghazali) and was also an unparalleled master of the entire rabbinic and biblical corpus. This makes him of special interest to students across a wide variety of areas, including religion, philosophy, politics, Jewish Studies and Middle Eastern Studies among others. No single student is likely to have a background in all these areas, so I want to emphasize that there are no prerequisites for the course.

As twenty-first century citizens, we have witnessed the power of data to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But we have also seen the power of data be used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This course will draw on the past several decades of intersectional feminist theory and activism in order to identify models for challenging differentials of power in data science, as well as methods of using data science to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data-scientific methods. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that intervene into issues of inequality and work towards justice. They will also produce final papers that document the results of their research.Participating students should have some familiarity with Python or a willingness to learn.)"}

(Technical Writing for Data Science - In this writing-intensive course, we will practice the effective and ethical communication of specialized technical knowledge and quantitative data. Because data are information given order, we will consider their arrangement and re-arrangement as rhetoric. We will introduce rhetorical analysis as a model for understanding how quantitative data can be interpreted and conveyed for multiple audiences that range from professional researchers to the lay public. Guided by this knowledge, you will exercise strategies for communicating via the text, speech, and visual conventions that are integral to preparing \"technical\" genres such as research reports, research translations, informative and persuasive infographics, instructions, and data repositories. We will adapt these genres and their conventions for our course goals that center collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, while emphasizing the methodological questions to ask when bringing new purposes to data prepared by others, as well as whom to ask, and how. As you gain comfort with thinking of writing and analysis as intertwined practices of exploratory inquiry, we will focus especially on how these practices shape the social impacts of our data-driven narratives.)"}

This insight is the starting point for the Buddha's teachings on the nature of the human condition and the possibility of human flourishing. Although suffering is universal, diverse causes of suffering can be identified. Once identified, these causes can be ameliorated so that the suffering they produce is either less harmful or even eliminated. Humans can learn how to live with suffering and to transform it into something beautiful, just as a gardener uses manure to nourish beautiful flowers. To turn suffering into a path of well-being, however, requires many skills. We need to learn how to look deeply to see the complex causes of suffering. Then we need to learn to see how these causes can be ameliorated or even undone. We also need to train in the methods for ameliorating and undoing the causes of suffering. These methods require work at the personal as well as the communal levels, at the surface as well as the deeper levels of our embodied minds. This course is an introduction to traditional and contemporary Buddhist theories of well-being, happiness, and flourishing, along with some of the methods designed to bring these about.)"}

Students will become familiar with major sociological, anthropological and hermeneutic approaches which pursue questions about the function, origin, comparison and language of religion. We will explore key terms in the contemporary study of religion such as culture, body, performance, rationality. Throughout, we will be concerned with the ways in which the category of religion has been and continues to be constructed by those who study it.

He was deeply steeped both in the Greco-Islamic philosophical tradition (i.e., Plato and Aristotle via writers like Alfarabi, Avicenna and Al-Ghazali) and was also an unparalleled master of the entire rabbinic and biblical corpus. This makes him of special interest to students across a wide variety of areas, including religion, philosophy, politics, Jewish Studies and Middle Eastern Studies among others. No single student is likely to have a background in all these areas, so I want to emphasize that there are no prerequisites for the course.

To request permission to register, contact Prof. María M. Carrión - mcarrio@emory.edu Law school schedule: Tuesdays, 1:00-3:55pm Interdisciplinary scholarship is often lauded for challenging assumptions, contributing new perspectives, and leading to groundbreaking new insights that would not be possible without crossing disciplinary borders. While there are certainly benefits to interdisciplinary scholarship, such approaches also pose a unique set of challenges. The success of interdisciplinary scholarship depends on the scholar's ability to communicate to audiences who often use different nomenclature, evidence, and analytical methods. A failure to appreciate these challenges can lead to attempts at interdisciplinary scholarship that are reductive, one- sided, vague, or confused. In this course, students will survey the interdisciplinary field of law and religion. The course will begin by discussing the nature of the field known as law and religion. What areas of inquiry constitute this field? What do we mean when we talk about 'law' and 'religion'? The course will then cover different substantive areas and methodological approaches by reading, analyzing, and critiquing examples of law and religion scholarship from leading scholars. Students will be asked to think about the choices that scholars make: What is the relationship of law and religion in this example of scholarship? What does the scholar draw on as evidence for the argument? How does the scholar construct the argument? How does the scholar think about law? How does the scholar think about religion? These and other questions will help students understand how different approaches function; what they can achieve; what they cannot achieve; and why a scholar would choose a certain approach. This course is recommended for students interested in exploring the field of law and religion, as well as for students in advance of a significant writing project in law and religion, including a journal comment, major seminar paper, or thesis. ATTENDANCE POLICY: Regular class attendance is expected. Absences will be factored into the class participation grade."}

What expectations might visitors to American or European museums and galleries have about art by an artist specifically identified with the continent of Africa? And how might expectations change if the art were not presented with a qualifier that linked the artist or the work to the continent? Answers to such questions impact where in a museum we might find an artist's work and how a museum might present the work. The course requires no previous study of the continent of Africa or African art. We will focus on arts created for worldwide audiences by diverse artists linked to different areas of the African continent. We will look at, read about, discuss, write about, and otherwise reflect upon a range of works in order to think about what various labels reveal and conceal about art, identity, and experience in national and transnational contexts.

This course will introduce students to the growing interdisciplinary field of development studies and provide a solid foundation for subsequent course work in the Global Development Studies Minor and, eventually, possible career tracks. Because of the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the topic, the course will include materials from a range of different academic disciplines, but with an emphasis on the social sciences especially anthropology. It will provide an overview of how scholars and practitioners research and apply their knowledge toward understanding and solving some of the world's most challenging problems. Through readings and class discussion, students will learn about several key topics related to development, including human rights, gender, environment, poverty and inequality, governance, climate change, and agrarian systems. Because of the current challenges of the recent COVID Pandemic, Inequality, Racism, and Social Justice in the US and around the world, we also will use the opportunity (\"a teaching moment\") to discuss these topics both in the context of global development, as well as \"development\" in high-income countries like the US.

This course provides students with the essential tools to analyze and interpret this data, empowering them to think critically about the strengths and challenges of quantitative methods in anthropology. In this hands-on course, students will dive into the core quantitative techniques used in anthropological research. With a focus on data collection, analysis, and interpretation, you'll gain practical experience applying statistical tools to real-world anthropological data. We'll go beyond theory to help you develop essential data analysis skills that you can use in any setting. The course combines lectures, interactive computer labs, and group discussions. Lectures will introduce key statistical concepts, while lab sessions provide the opportunity to put these concepts into practice using R statistical software. In group discussions, you'll collaborate with classmates to refine your analytical skills and deepen your understanding of how quantitative methods can be applied to anthropological questions. By the end of the course, you'll feel confident in using quantitative approaches to explore and answer the complex questions at the heart of anthropological research.

Simultaneously, increased calls to decolonize ethnographic research and produce work for wider publics are leading to increased experimentation with ethnographic research design and genres of research dissemination. This advanced seminar examines these developments, and provides a workshop setting for students to produce their own projects, based on original research. We will explore modes of social science and humanistic experimentation, and we will evaluate projects for their impact, ethics, and relevance. Students will examine and practice a variety of ethnographic methods for gathering data and documenting the human condition in different genres, including multimodal, multisensorial, and performance-based formats. Requirements include: Preparation for each class day, active participation in discussions, short assignments, and a team project based on original ethnographic research.

Think: multisensorial qualitative research based seminar-lab-workshop-collaboratory! Students will learn how contemporary anthropologists are engaged in a range of theater making initiatives, forging new connections and engagements across techniques, traditions, and stakeholders. We will explore -- and practice -- the crafts of transitioning between ethnographic research, scriptwriting, acting, and staging. Our questions include: How does the ethnographer vividly convey the textures of life? How is analysis integrated with description? How are embodiment, affect, and multisensorial experiences documented ethnographically -- and conveyed through performance modalities? What are the ethical and moral responsibilities and implications of this kind of work? What are its political and liberatory potentialities? Students will develop skills through fieldwork exercises, movement techniques, theater games, and physical theater methods. Over the semester, students will produce ethnographic performances based on their own original research, and will present their projects in a semester-end showcase.

For decades, studies on primate behavior have provided us with a lens to observe our ancestral past. Since the onset of the discipline, primatology has continued to evolve, with the integration of novel methodologies that have placed studies on primate behavior at the forefront of anthropology, social sciences, animal behavior, psychology, and medicine. This seminar focuses on the past, present, and future of primatology by examining the discipline's theoretical roots and the groundbreaking studies that address current problems in primate behavior and primate cognition. By reading and discussing both novel studies and \"old\" seminal scientific papers, this course will challenge you to understand historical perspectives, consider theoretical advances, examine methodological approaches, and critically assess the future trajectories of primatology."}

Students will meet weekly to learn about specialty coffee and collectively support coffee growers from Guatemala and Honduras. In the first four meetings, students will read about and discuss issues related to specialty coffee and storytelling. Then, students will be introduced to participating coffee growers. During each 3-Day Storytelling Workshop, students will work with growers to cultivate a deeper appreciation for how effective farm stories can enhance economic opportunities. In the post-workshop meetings, students will continue to work with their assigned growers to complete, review, and refine their stores. Completed stories will be posted on a dedicated website."}

In this course, we will explore what science can tell us about what actually makes people happy both personally and professionally. We will begin by examining how scientists define and measure happiness and some of the benefits of happiness for individuals and organizations. Next, we will examine the features of our minds that often make us less happy and how to combat them. We will then turn to what science can teach us about how to be happier, less stressed, and more fulfilled in our personal and professional lives. Students will have multiple opportunities to put these practices into action and will be encouraged to develop ways to build them into their current and future lives."}

This is a participatory course where students learn and practice creative forms of research-based theater making. Every day will be dynamic, in action, observing/documenting/exploring the human condition and humans' relations to lived environments and the natural world. Think: multisensorial qualitative research based seminar-lab-workshop-collaboratory! Students will learn how contemporary anthropologists are engaged in a range of theater making initiatives, forging new connections and engagements across techniques, traditions, and stakeholders. We will explore -- and practice -- the crafts of transitioning between ethnographic research, scriptwriting, acting, and staging. Our questions include: How does the ethnographer vividly convey the textures of life? How is analysis integrated with description? How are embodiment, affect, and multisensorial experiences documented ethnographically -- and conveyed through performance modalities? What are the ethical and moral responsibilities and implications of this kind of work? What are its political and liberatory potentialities? Students will develop skills through fieldwork exercises, movement techniques, theater games, and physical theater methods. Over the semester, students will produce ethnographic performances based on their own original research, and will present their projects in a semester-end showcase. No prior acting or performance experience is required."}

{"code": "MATH 385", "title": "Topics in Mathematics: Problem-Solving Strategies", "credits": "3", "typically_offered": "", "ger": "", "requirement_sentence": "One of the key skills for anyone engaged in fields such as programming and mathematics is the ability to solve challenging problems. In most mathematics courses such as Calculus, the majority of problems follow standard solution algorithms and require a minimal set of ideas. Unfortunately, within the framework of such courses, instructors are often reluctant to challenge students with difficult problems. However, if you are interested in mathematics --- especially if you see it as your major, a potential career path, or even if you wish to participate in mathematical or coding competitions --- it is crucial to develop strong problem-solving skills. As is often the case, the only time-tested approach to mastering this skill is to tackle new mathematical problems. The goal of this course is to introduce and practice with a wide range of ideas, techniques, and methods that can aid in this endeavor. As the name of this course suggests, there will be a significant emphasis on problem-solving practice. Some of these problems will be taken directly from competitions such as PUTNAM or the International Mathematical Olympiads. Other problems might serve as lemmas in a research paper. Our aim is to `merge' these two approaches, the competitive and the exploratory. Prerequisites: Math 250 or equivalent Please email MATH-REGISTRATION@LISTSERV.CC.EMORY.EDU for permission."}

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today.

Intro. to Literary Theory and Criticism) (In read, think, write we will study the various ways in which scholars of literature instruct their readers on how to interpret literature, argue about its value, and the role it plays in society. Learning about each of the theoretical frameworks will allow you to not only learn about the ways scholars have tried to interpret texts, but also to critically read literature using the methods they have developed. We will address questions such as: how to read a literary text from a Feminist, Queer, Marxist or post-colonial perspective? We will learn about how these schools of thought emerged, some of the most prominent theorists, and the central questions they ask when critically analyzing a text. Student will choose literary pieces to perform different styles of critical interpretations from different literary theories. The goal is to provide you with a foundation for understanding how literature is discussed in scholarly and critical discourse.) Required Texts: -Vincent Leitch, et.al.

Inventing Time in Short Fiction This course expands craft concepts introduced in introductory creative writing coursework with a special focus on the narrative possibilities of time. How might we maintain a short story's necessary \"intensity of focus\" within a timeframe that spans centuries? How might a short story that takes place over the course of an hour give every detail heightened significance? In addition to exploring the narrative pressures of different timeframes, we will look at stories that break linearity, gesturing toward the future and even using elements like time travel to negotiate the constraints of the short story form. Selections from contemporary short fiction authors like Venita Blackburn, Sean Vestal, Mariah Rigg, Jonathan Escoffery, Brenda Peynado, Steven Millhauser, Ted Chiang, and Sofia Samatar will be included in our studies."}

FORMS In this intermediate course, you will find a community of poets serious about their craft, hoping to deepen their engagement with the art of poetry. Through the shared sense of trust and endeavor provided by the workshop community, we will closely read the work of published poets and that of our peers as we draft new poems ourselves. To structure our in-class discussions and the weekly creation of new work, we will look closely at prosody and the resurgence of traditional forms in the work of contemporary American poets. As we try out various forms ourselves, we will situate our own poetic experiments in a centuries-long conversation extending to our present moment."}

That truth is then brought to an audience to react, decide, reflect, and revolt. Plays are a singular democratic practice and gift in the human experience. Every single one of us has brilliant plays inside us, stories that connect others and help people feel alive, but how do we tell them? How do you figure out and access your truth - but more importantly, how can you make your truth legible to the outside world? In Intermediate Playwriting, we will be learning various elements of the craft, voyaging over a century worth of American playwrights to learn different tools and techniques, but more importantly for you to access what excites you and what themes you'd like your work to be in conversation with. In breaking down literary texts and exploring theatrical history, I often pose the central questions: What makes a play a play? What is theatricality? By investigating the foundations of story and identifying the elements that make a text theatrical, students develop a deeper understanding of both the craft and the medium. We will do this over a series of multiple exercises, and you will write a one-act play."}

Nonfiction Magazine and Long-form Writing. No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. This workshop is focused on long-form, nonfiction magazine and feature writing -- reading it, reporting it, writing it, and doing so in ways and by means that separate the exceptional from the pedestrian. This is nonfiction. Be prepared to be a reporter, to meet people face-to-face, to ask questions, to see and hear things with your own eyes and ears. My goal is to get your work published. We'll have visiting experts on hand as we discuss where great ideas come from, how to be strategic in your reporting, the art of the interview, and crafting stories, then stories within stories. We're looking mostly at print, but we will see beyond the dead tree media at the growing opportunities for magazine-style writing and long-form narratives online. Ultimately, the goal of the course is for you to become a considerably wiser and more effective nonfiction storyteller, for which the basis is sound reporting. Students should budget to purchase the textbook and for photocopying."}

In the years between 1945 and 1968, untold numbers of American citizens were targeted for death because of their race, beliefs, or civil rights work - and in some cases merely because of what they drove, how they spoke, or the ever-shifting lines of racial etiquette they crossed. In many cases, their murders were inadequately investigated or prosecuted, their stories left untold, and the crimes against their humanity never punished. The Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project at Emory University is both a class and an ongoing historical and journalistic exploration of the Jim Crow South through the prism of unsolved or unpunished civil rights-era murders in Georgia. Using primary evidence including FBI records, NAACP files, old newspaper clippings, court transcripts, and personal archives students come to see and understand history from the inside out. Student essays, grounded in secondary readings that provide broader context, will be aimed at the project website, coldcases.emory.edu. Students also may become engaged in helping research a new season of the podcast, Buried Truths, based on a case we'll be examining in class. Students should budget for photocopying."}

This course explores the contributions of the theologian, mystic, and often-overlooked Civil Rights hero Howard Thurman on how people can work to establish, build, and extend community.

After an examination of Thurman's life and thought, the course will focus on his interpretations of Jesus's Prodigal Son and Good Samaritan parables, because they illustrate Thurman's understanding of how to (re)establish community. In brief, Thurman's mysticism, its relationship with social change, and his practice of using the fine arts to raise one's spiritual consciousness and foster community, encourage a \"sympathetic understanding\" of other human beings."}
