How do they shed light on moments of deep change in society? How do they uphold, unveil or even challenge long settled structures of inequality brought about by Portugal's maritime expansion begun in the 1400s? This course invites students to reflect on the relationship between literature and history by examining fictional narratives and historical documents from the Lusophone world (Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique). In addition to practicing their advanced Portuguese, students will engage with some of the most foundational and interdisciplinary questions in literary studies, that is the relationship between literary (fictional) discourse and the historical past. Students will acquire familiarity with some of the most important literary genres from the time of Portugal's colonial expansion, and then examine the various legacies of the early modern period in contemporary novels written in Brazil, Angola and Mozambique. Students will also think through the proposed questions by analyzing documents about important events in Portugal's and Brazil's history, namely the Battle of Alcácer Quibir and the biggest maroon kingdom, the Quilombo dos Palmares. Readings from the early modern period (16th century) include Bernardim Ribeiro, Luis de Camões, Fernão Mendes Pinto, and from the modern period (20th and 21st centuries) Ana Maria Gonçalves, José Eduardo Agualusa, Mia Couto, Paulina Chiziane.

Reading our way through some of Woolf's major novels as well as selected essays, stories, and autobiographical writing, we will think about Woolf as a critic, humorist, feminist, and literary innovator, with special consideration to the way Woolf reinvents representations of character and human consciousness. While we focus on Woolf's illuminations of the interior self, we will also explore the adventurous artistic and philosophical spirit of Bloomsbury and how her work reflects England's transformation in the first half of the twentieth century: world war and its aftermath, changing social and sexual mores, new conceptions of gender roles and women's rights, advances in human psychology, and contemporaneous developments in painting and design.

Not unhelpful? Insightful? Necessary? for what, and for whom? --is the poem a work of art in its own right, and how do we know, and how does that matter? --is the artwork addressed instrumentalized by the poem in any way?

We will engage with fiction writing as always about creating human beings with histories, bodies, and social realities; as always about creating a world anew for an audience; and as always a form of communication with an ongoing humanity -- be it dead writers, current beloveds, future anonymous readers or one's own self. Students will come to understand the fiction workshop as a place to face fears, biases and the limitations of the imagination all via practice and hard work. Students will come to see fiction as a place to communicate as writers and critics. Students come to see fiction writing and critical reading as a place to engage bravely and vulnerably with grief, joy and the full range of human emotions between."}

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

Whether you are a yes or a maybe, you probably aren't sure how to get started, and like many students you may be feeling intimidated or uncertain about identifying a topic, doing independent research, or getting the help you need. Seniors consistently say writing a thesis was the most rewarding experience of their undergraduate education, yet many well-qualified students miss the opportunity or give up because they started too late. If you are an honors-curious junior or sophomore in the humanities or qualitative social sciences, this class is for you! Taught in a workshop/seminar format that will create a supportive, interdisciplinary intellectual community, this class is designed to facilitate your individual exploration process and help you get a head start on your project in conversation with peers and mentors. As you identify and begin to develop your research project, you will formulate or refine your topic and methods, explore what our library has to offer, enhance your oral communication skills, and work with faculty mentors to develop a plan for success. Starting early will also enable you to identify and apply for opportunities (such as funds for travel to archives and senior research seminars) that will enhance your project and provide invaluable experience. This workshop will support you in getting started on your honors thesis and help you put together the pieces that will lead to a successful outcome in your senior year."}

It considers the common roots of the spirituals, blues, and jazz, and surveys the historical, cultural, social, and denominational factors that have helped to shape our perspective on the spiritual capacity of jazz. Any exploration of this type must include an interrogation of the intersection of race, racism, and ethnicity. Notions of the sacred/secular as well as the origins of the stigmas associated with jazz as the devil's music will be examined in detail. This course will focus on the sacred works, biographies, and implicit theological positions of six jazz masters: Mary Lou Williams, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, Sun Ra, and Yusef Lateef. Each of these masters elected a distinct and different path in the musical expression of their spirituality. Significant Buddhist (Herbie Hancock) and Baha'i (Dizzy Gillespie) jazz communities will also be considered."}

A touchstone for our discussions will be the philosopher John Locke's reinvention of the human mind, in his 1690 Essay Concerning Human Understanding: \"Let us then suppose the mind to be, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be furnished?\" Locke's answer to this question, \"experience,\" had an enormous impact on the intellectual landscape of the century that followed. On the one hand, Locke's argument that our ideas are derived from the senses suggested that individuals are the products of their own experience, and thus have, in some measure, the power to shape their own lives. On the other hand, the shaping power that Locke attributed to experience conjured up the danger that our minds and our lives are always at the mercy of various external forces: including family and friends, enemies and competitors, as well as an array of social, cultural, and political settings, institutions, and ideologies. More than any other form of literary expression in the eighteenth century, the novel took up the challenge of imagining and embodying, even at times resisting, the power of experience. We will study the novels of Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Jane Austen, among others. Written work will include 3 essays, weekly Canvas postings, and a take-home final exam. of exams and essays"}

Students engage with historical sources and draw on gender and legal studies, alongside various fields of history, to examine these questions as a lens into power relations and broader legal, religious, and social developments during this diverse period. We will also probe societies and communities and their evolution over time, tracing continuity and change in women¿s legal standing, and reflecting on women and the law in modern and contemporary societies. Some of the questions we will ask include: What is the relationship between law and lived legal experiences? What strategies did women develop to navigate legal situations that affected themselves, their families, and their communities? How did they engage with marriage and divorce laws, as well as matters related to family law and inheritance? Were women involved in crime, and were there particular crimes associated with women? Did the law hinder women¿s roles in business? While this class primarily focuses on Europe, we will also examine the diverse legal standings and lived experiences of Muslim women, drawing comparisons between Europe and the Middle East, including the Ottoman Empire."}

No human has been beyond Earth's orbit since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972. The Apollo missions were extraordinary scientific achievements; they were also historical events located in particular social contexts. This seminar course takes a sociological approach to explore the Apollo era (1961-1972), focusing on four main areas: \"Spaceflight\" \"Astronaut,\" \"Astronaut Family,\" and \"NASA.\" We will begin with brief background on the political, technological, and broader social contexts of the time. Then we will delve deeper into various social and cultural aspects of these four new realities: \"Spaceflight\" (e.g., media constructions and projections), \"Astronaut\" (e.g., links to test pilot culture; gendered construction of a new occupation), \"Astronaut Family\" (e.g., relationship with the press; the unpaid work roles of wives; creating new NASA communities) and \"NASA\" (e.g., PR efforts and image constructions; early organizational culture). Students will work with primary source material from the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript and Rare Book Library, the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship's Apollo 15 Learning Hub as well as other digital archival material (from data collected by Professor Scott) to create their own projects on one of the main topic areas. Requirements: Three short research assignments that will build into a final project, in the form of an op-ed article. Drafts of the final project will be peer reviewed and discussed in class.

Complete Topic: Religion and the Quest for Meaning. How should we live? What and whom should we care about? What are the commitments and projects that bring purpose to our lives? These are among the most enduring and important questions humans have wrestled with, questions demanded of anyone aspiring to live a meaningful life instead of sleepwalking through it. In this course, we explore the human quest for meaning through a survey of the world's religious traditions. Religions have always been among the most reliable sources of moral ideals, and among the most successful at inculcating those ideals through the practices, communities, and narratives they provision. Yet the centrality of religion for moral formation stands in tension with the secular and pluralistic character of the world we now inhabit. In this course, we attend to the difficulties as well as the possibilities of forging connections, communities, and commitments when traditional religious outlooks are no longer widely shared or taken for granted. We also query the limits of the category of \"meaning\" by considering aspects of religion that go beyond discursive coherence, that tap into the irreducibility of human experience."}

Yet they are strikingly different too: Virgil's epic of national origins places the cataclysmic events of his own lifetime in a scheme of fate and historical causation reaching back to Rome's mythic origins, while Dante's poem, though also deeply ingrained in history, explores the place of the Christian soul in the great drama of sin and redemption. Vergil and Dante both became national poets in retrospect, and both conceived their great works under the profound influence of previous epic poetry. For Vergil that previous influence was primarily Homer, for Dante Vergil. Our primary goal is a close reading of both poems in their contexts, but we shall also consider how literary canons are formed, how works are re-read in later times, and what the definition of a classic is. Both works will be read in English translation, but students with knowledge of Latin or Italian or both will be invited to contribute their perspectives based on reading in the originals as well."}

(Suffering is a universal feature of human life. No one who lives does not also suffer. This insight is the starting point for the Buddha's teachings on the nature of the human condition and the possibility of human flourishing. Although suffering is universal, diverse causes of suffering can be identified. Once identified, these causes can be ameliorated so that the suffering they produce is either less harmful or even eliminated. Humans can learn how to live with suffering and to transform it into something beautiful, just as a gardener uses manure to nourish beautiful flowers. To turn suffering into a path of well-being, however, requires many skills. We need to learn how to look deeply to see the complex causes of suffering. Then we need to learn to see how these causes can be ameliorated or even undone. We also need to train in the methods for ameliorating and undoing the causes of suffering. These methods require work at the personal as well as the communal levels, at the surface as well as the deeper levels of our embodied minds. This course is an introduction to traditional and contemporary Buddhist theories of well-being, happiness, and flourishing, along with some of the methods designed to bring these about.)"}

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

Nonfiction Magazine and Long-form Writing. No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. This workshop is focused on long-form, nonfiction magazine and feature writing -- reading it, reporting it, writing it, and doing so in ways and by means that separate the exceptional from the pedestrian. This is nonfiction. Be prepared to be a reporter, to meet people face-to-face, to ask questions, to see and hear things with your own eyes and ears. My goal is to get your work published. We'll have visiting experts on hand as we discuss where great ideas come from, how to be strategic in your reporting, the art of the interview, and crafting stories, then stories within stories. We're looking mostly at print, but we will see beyond the dead tree media at the growing opportunities for magazine-style writing and long-form narratives online. Ultimately, the goal of the course is for you to become a considerably wiser and more effective nonfiction storyteller, for which the basis is sound reporting. Students should budget to purchase the textbook and for photocopying."}

This course will introduce students to the pre-1990s cultures of working-class transfeminine street queens and drag queens, working-class Black and Latina ballroom femme queens, white, upper-middle class heterosexual cross-dressers, transsexual women desperately trying to stave off downward mobility, working-class butches, and passing men. We will analyze what happened during the 1990s to create a shared \"trans community,\" and whose class and race interests won out in this process. We explore a wide genre of artifacts to get to know these trans cultures including oral histories, autobiographies, magazines, documentaries, ethnographies, sociological reports, and medical texts."}

With a single building, or group of buildings, as the focal point of each lecture, we will move through time considering issues such as: materials, massing, and monumentality; the Vitruvian triad of firmitas, utilitas et venustas (strength, utility, and delight); gravity-defying Gothic structures; domes and their reinvention; the aesthetics of technological innovation; the myriad directions of contemporary design. The subject is vast. Rather than trace a linear history we have selected major monuments that drive the development of architecture.

We will further explore how all of the cellular components are governed, by kinetic and non-kinetic controls, to produce a coherent and responsive metabolism that efficiently creates and utilizes the energy stored in chemical compounds, such as glucose and fats. Human metabolic disorders such as diabetes will provide models of how metabolism is controlled at the systematic level in complex organisms using biochemical signaling pathways to coordinate metabolic pathways in different tissues.

While hugely inspired by Dada, surrealism's revolutionary attitude came from combining avant-garde sensibilities with the insights of Freudian psychoanalysis. Artistic creation would be informed by theories of the unconscious and the strange world of meaning that we encounter in dreams. The ideas of surrealism were applied in literature, painting, photography, architecture, theatre, etc., and also went beyond art into a major critique of politics. In this course, we will read, analyze, and discuss works from the founding generation of surrealists and the intellectual circle surrounding André Breton. Our focus will be to examine and compare works from three components of the surrealist movement: theatre, poetry, and painting. We will begin with the formal and linguistic innovations of surrealist poetry, then move to depictions of the work of desire in painting, and conclude with the radically improvisational Theatre of Cruelty. Key writers and artists will include Paul Éluard, Georges Bataille, Antonin Artaud, Salvador Dalí, and Frida Kahlo. Some of the larger questions we will address are: - How are the theoretical ideas of surrealism affirmed and contested by different artistic media? - How do surrealists respond to the traditional values of \"high art\"? - How can we cultivate the \"wild eye\" when viewing visual art and hear the \"surrealist voice\" in poetry? - What do surrealists mean when they speak of new forms of life? - How does surrealism relate to revolutionary politics? Assignments will include reflections on writing produced using surrealist methods (automatic writing, the \"cut-up method\"), a set of \"close readings\" of paintings, and a research paper discussing class-relevant topics.)"}

These moments are even more intensified in the ways they have been racialized and stand within a longer racial history of terror. To this extent, the course begins by examining the racial construction of gender and how the law becomes a tool of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender repression. It will explore cases in slave law to broaden its view on constitutional and statute law as well as other concepts of laws (e.g. psychic, notions of sexual difference, aesthetic).

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

Content: As Fabienne Kanor reflects in an interview: \"J'ai mal à mon histoire et la réécrire est le seul moyen que j'ai trouvé pour guérir un peu\" (\"My history hurts me, and rewriting it is the only way I have found to heal a little\"). This course takes up Kanor's insight as its guiding principle, exploring how artistic creation becomes a pathway to healing from historical trauma. How do artists transform pain into power? How can creativity help us heal from historical trauma and imagine new possibilities? This course invites you to explore how predominantly Black women artists and artists featuring Black women characters across the francophone world (from Senegal to Martinique, France to Vietnam, Cameroon to Reunion Island) use film, literature, poetry, performance, and visual arts as tools for healing and resistance. Through hands-on creative projects and rigorous literary and cultural analysis, you'll develop your own practice while learning concepts like \"cartographies of memory\" and \"aquatic metaphors\" as ways to understand healing journeys across the diasporas. You'll collaborate with visiting artist TIE on her project \"Odyssey in Black Utero,\" exploring how art creates healing pathways between past and future. Your final project? Create your own \"map to elsewhere\" a creative work that visualizes connections between historical memory and imagined futures. No prior art experience necessary: just curiosity and openness to creative exploration.

We will consider how space and place shape data as well as how data shape human experiences of space and place. In addition, we will think about how artists and other makers center data in their creative processes. Our studies of art and data will draw on specific examples linked to Africa and other geographies at different moments in time. Yet, the relevance of our investigations transcends any single geography or time period. And as a course in the humanities, we will also reflect on what it means for any person, whether from here and now or another place and time, to be human; to embrace our shared humanity; and to engage with digital technologies. The course is designed for curious students eager to reflect on what art and data can teach us about past and present human experiences and the world. The course features creative assignments. It also relies on students' deep reading, close looking, attentive listening, engaged discussion, and mutual respect; it is not a lecture course.

In doing this, we will think deeply about how humanity defines itself through and against its own narratives of power and dominance. -Where are we going?

FREN 488. Hauntings: Literature, Psychoanalysis, Film Prof. Claire Nouvet / Mondays and Wednesdays, 1:00-2:15PM. Content: With the study of hysteria, Freud discovered the process of repression and elaborated the concept of the unconscious. The unconscious, however, does not rest quietly. It returns to haunt the present through various disruptions that conscious thought does not know how to explain to itself: slips of the tongue, dreams, phobias, anxieties, delusions. If we learn from psychoanalysis that a past that has been repressed can return to disrupt the present, literature, for its part, has its own way of staging these uncanny returns. What comes back under the figures of the ghosts, vampires, and witches that haunt the literary stage? How do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget? These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature, psychoanalysis and film. Special attention will be given to the way psychoanalysis addresses the issue of trauma not only at the individual level but also at the collective level: transgenerational transmission of historical traumas.

Readings and discussions will introduce representational ethics and reflect on when debate is worthwhile, given good/bad faith, alongside alternatives to agonism like listening and mutual vulnerability. Students will practice narrative and analytical writing assignments attentive to differences of perspective, evidentiary logics, and multiple affected communities."}

Far from being a time of decline, these periods witnessed the construction of great temples, the creation of new works that fused indigenous Egyptian forms with the styles and mediums of Greek and Roman art, and the production more mummies than any other time in Egyptian history.

How did they achieve that? But also, are such temples their only architectural achievements worth studying? This course offers a broad introduction to Greek architecture, from monumental sanctuaries and civic structures to domestic houses and everyday spaces. The course covers the essentials: architectural orders and styles, building materials, construction techniques, and the roles of architects and workshops. At the same time, it addresses broader questions, such as: How did architecture shape ritual and social life? How did thresholds, lighting, and access structure bodily encounters with the sacred? How did houses and civic buildings reflect cultural values and community identity? In collaboration with Emory's Center for Digital Scholarship, students gain experience with digital tools used to reconstruct and visualize ancient buildings not only to see how they once looked, but also to explore how design affected movement, perception, and interaction, both with the divine and among mortals. Greek architecture, approached through architectural history, classics, anthropology, and digital humanities, emerges not only as a technical achievement but also as a cultural system that structured ancient lives, shaping notions of space, community, and the sacred.

It will be assumed that students are already familiar with the goals of linguistic inquiry and the methods of basic syntactic analysis (trees, categories, constituency tests). If you have not taken Foundations of Linguistics (LING-201/ANT-203), or an equivalent course, you will be required to do significant extra self-instructional work at the beginning of the semester. What we do in this course: Much of the language you hear over the course of a day consists of sentences you have never heard before, and yet you are able to understand them. How is this possible? The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its words and the way they are combined. In the first part of this course, students will learn a system for doing just this - combining phrase structure trees and computing the meanings that result, using the formal language of predicate logic to represent sentence meanings. Then, in the second part of the course, we'll focus on utterance meaning - aspects of meaning that go beyond what is shown in the predicate logic. For example, what enables us to understand a sentence like `There's ice cream on your shirt' as a simple informative description in some contexts, as an accusation in others, and as a warning in still others? We'll discuss speech acts, implicature, presupposition and other aspects of utterance meaning as we explore the close relationship between semantics and pragmatics.

The course will include sessions that examine previous bouts of armed conflict as well as various attempts at peace, but war and politics will not be the course's only foci; the lived experiences of Palestinians and Israelis will also receive significant attention, from historical times through the present day. These voices include a young Jewish female spy who helped the British defeat the Ottoman Empire; an Islamist rebel whose death inspired the Great Arab Revolt of the 1930s; a Holocaust survivor who fought in the 1948 war before becoming Israel's leading poet; girls whose families fled from Jerusalem and Libya, and grew up amidst poverty and war; a U.S.-trained heart surgeon-turned-PLO militant who was assassinated in his quest for peace, and many others."}

A central question during the ancient period will be, what was \"Judaism\" and how did it emerge out of the diverse religious landscape of antiquity? The medieval period will focus on the interface between Jewish communities and the states or empires in which they lived. Particular attention will be paid to the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslim peoples and cultures. In the modern period, we will analyze the processes by which governments, politicians and some segments of Jews attempted to incorporate the Jews and Judaism into European society and the various problems and reactions engendered by the quest for Jewish emancipation and social integration."}

We will focus on the social significance of race by examining the reality of racial stratification, the reality of the experience of racism, race, ethnicity, and nation, and the rationality of those who study racial dynamics and processes. The first portion of the course disentangles how race was leveraged to establish the sciences as an effective tool to understand and change society. The second portion of the course describes sociological theories of prejudice, privilege, and power to understand racism and racial stratification. The third portion of the course surveys empirical readings in Sociology that consider the state of ethnoracial inequality in the primary social institutions of society and everyday life opportunities. Throughout we consider how social change in social attitudes, classification systems, and policies shape the current global landscape of racism along the imperial projects of race, ethnicity, nation. The end product of the course increases competency in understanding the origins, dynamics, and state of racial and ethnic relations using the language and tools of Sociology through its scientific study of society."}
