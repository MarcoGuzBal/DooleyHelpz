Yet those portrayals overlook the historical complexities that have led to current events. In this course, we aim to challenge limited narratives of Africa's contemporary realities by delving into the people, events, and processes that have shaped the continent. Given the vast size of Africa, the course will focus on specific themes and cases. These will include the end of the Atlantic slave trade and the transition to \"legitimate\" commerce; the motivations for and establishment of colonial rule; economic, social, and cultural transformations; African resistance to colonialism and decolonization; and post-colonial political trajectories. Altogether, this course examines the internal and external dynamics of change in Africa.)"}

We will use African writings as a mirror through which we can examine the historical trajectory of Africa. At the heart of this course lies a central question: How did Africans make sense of their world? We will explore this by examining how Africans understood broader historical events such as Islamic and Atlantic slavery, colonialism, and decolonization and specific events such as the Biafran War and the independence of Ghana. We will take a chronological and thematic survey of African history considering issues such as racism, gender, war, and resistance, moving from the period before colonial incursion to the colonial and postcolonial periods. We will explore fiction and non-fiction works, including oral traditions put to text like the Epic of Sunjata and the works of colonial and postcolonial African writers such as Chinua Achebe, Ayi Kwei Armah, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Chimamanda Adichie, Camara Laye, Buchi Emecheta, among others.

For example, how does the Black Lives Matter movement grow out of and build upon the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s? Or, How do current debates on immigration echo those of a century ago? Throughout, we will interrogate how people experience disruptive cultural events through the lens of their own identities and roles in American society. We will consider how media narratives and cultural discourses shape our public understanding of these events and in turn encourage (or inhibit) social change. Atlanta, with its rich and complex historical legacy and rapid contemporary transformations, will serve as our primary site of engagement for these questions. The city will be woven into the curriculum through the engagement with historical texts, visual archives, guest lectures with local scholars, artists, and activists, and a field trip."}

This phenomenon was not only seen among Haitian women writers, but among Anglophone and Francophone Caribbean women writers in general. Building from this work, this course will explore how Anglophone and Francophone Caribbean women writers such as Sylvia Wynter, Gisèle Pineau, Shani Mootoo, Nalo Hopkinson, Fabienne Kanor, and Edwidge Danticat include portrayals of gender-based violence in their works to theorize racism, sexism, and coloniality.

While hugely inspired by Dada, surrealism's revolutionary attitude came from combining avant-garde sensibilities with the insights of Freudian psychoanalysis. Artistic creation would be informed by theories of the unconscious and the strange world of meaning that we encounter in dreams. The ideas of surrealism were applied in literature, painting, photography, architecture, theatre, etc., and also went beyond art into a major critique of politics. In this course, we will read, analyze, and discuss works from the founding generation of surrealists and the intellectual circle surrounding André Breton. Our focus will be to examine and compare works from three components of the surrealist movement: theatre, poetry, and painting. We will begin with the formal and linguistic innovations of surrealist poetry, then move to depictions of the work of desire in painting, and conclude with the radically improvisational Theatre of Cruelty. Key writers and artists will include Paul Éluard, Georges Bataille, Antonin Artaud, Salvador Dalí, and Frida Kahlo. Some of the larger questions we will address are: - How are the theoretical ideas of surrealism affirmed and contested by different artistic media? - How do surrealists respond to the traditional values of \"high art\"? - How can we cultivate the \"wild eye\" when viewing visual art and hear the \"surrealist voice\" in poetry? - What do surrealists mean when they speak of new forms of life? - How does surrealism relate to revolutionary politics? Assignments will include reflections on writing produced using surrealist methods (automatic writing, the \"cut-up method\"), a set of \"close readings\" of paintings, and a research paper discussing class-relevant topics.)"}

While world literature courses often revolve around the novel as the form closely associated with modernity, nationhood, and global circulation, poetry predates the novel, has long and rich histories in many languages and cultures, and continues to shape global consciousness in ways both intimate and political.) Shifting the focus to poetry, this course explores how poetic forms, such as the ghazal, sonnet, elegy, and lyric, travel across time and language. We will take up the debates around translation and untranslatability, consider how poetry responds to global forces like colonialism, transnational movements, globalization, and climate crisis, and examine how poetics intersects with politics.

These moments are even more intensified in the ways they have been racialized and stand within a longer racial history of terror. To this extent, the course begins by examining the racial construction of gender and how the law becomes a tool of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender repression. It will explore cases in slave law to broaden its view on constitutional and statute law as well as other concepts of laws (e.g. psychic, notions of sexual difference, aesthetic).

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

The focus of this course will be to use these in-lab tutorials to understand how neuroscience data is structured, analyzed, simulated, and interpreted. The course will be divided into 2 portions: (1) coding, running, and interpreting simulations of neural activity, and (2) understanding the analysis of neural data. The course consists of lectures, group lab tutorials, and individual homework assignments for each module. This course originates in the Biology Department, and it will count as an elective and upper-level laboratory credit for the Biology major.

A central question during the ancient period will be, what was \"Judaism\" and how did it emerge out of the diverse religious landscape of antiquity? The medieval period will focus on the interface between Jewish communities and the states or empires in which they lived. Particular attention will be paid to the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslim peoples and cultures. In the modern period, we will analyze the processes by which governments, politicians and some segments of Jews attempted to incorporate the Jews and Judaism into European society and the various problems and reactions engendered by the quest for Jewish emancipation and social integration."}

This course will be broken into four major sections: 1) Present-Day Features of AAL, with a focus on its vocabulary (lexicon), pronunciation features (phonetics and phonology) and grammar (morphology and syntax); 2) The History of AAL and its ongoing trajectory of change, focusing on earlier examples of AAL, its possible origins and whether or not AAL is diverging from Mainstream American English (MAE) and other varieties of English; 3) AAL as a Living Art will discuss AAL as it is employed as an expression of art by writers, musicians, as well as its use in African American speech events, and avenues for outreach; 4) AAL, Education and Society will examine issues related to AAL and education, the justice system, linguistic profiling and discrimination in other areas of society such as housing and employment."}

The course is structured into three distinct units. Unit 1 addresses foundational inquiries pertaining to legal history. The objective of this unit is to establish a conceptual framework for analyzing law and legal orders in global perspective. Unit 2 investigates the interactions of law, society, and economy in a particular place and time, with emphasis on specific themes. Students will work with secondary literature, case studies, and primary sources. The content of Unit 2 varies, according to the research specialization and interests of the faculty member teaching the course. Unit 3 requires students to apply what they learned in Units 1 and 2 in a hands-on group project. In this iteration of HIST 210, taught by Professor Chris Suh, Unit 2 will focus on the topics of citizenship, civil rights, and precarity in the United States from the late 19th century to the present. Case studies will focus on Asian Americans' experiences with the law."}

We will use African writings as a mirror through which we can examine the historical trajectory of Africa. At the heart of this course lies a central question: How did Africans make sense of their world? We will explore this by examining how Africans understood broader historical events such as Islamic and Atlantic slavery, colonialism, and decolonization and specific events such as the Biafran War and the independence of Ghana. We will take a chronological and thematic survey of African history considering issues such as racism, gender, war, and resistance, moving from the period before colonial incursion to the colonial and postcolonial periods. We will explore fiction and non-fiction works, including oral traditions put to text like the Epic of Sunjata and the works of colonial and postcolonial African writers such as Chinua Achebe, Ayi Kwei Armah, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Chimamanda Adichie, Camara Laye, Buchi Emecheta, among others. These texts will serve not only as literary artifacts but also as historical documents that illuminate African perspectives, epistemologies, and modes of resistance.)"}

The creation of this \"people's community\" was to be achieved by violently excluding people who were deemed \"deviant\" from the norms the Nazi Party was propagating. The class examines the interplay between inclusion and exclusion and hence the production of \"outsiders\". Topics in this class include the biologization of politics; the application and radicalization of \"racial hygiene\" (eugenics); the history of the autism diagnosis; the regime's ableism; the persecution of homosexuals; and the centrality of antisemitism to all social and political Nazi projects. These topics will be introduced by an overview of the political history and ideology of German culture from the 1920s to 1945. We will analyze written primary sources, film propaganda, and present-day reverberations of this history. This course fulfills the Emory College Continuing Communication and Writing Requirement.)"}

Students will explore themes such as expulsions, mass conversions, persecution, the print and scientific revolutions, the development of Jewish legal systems and Jewish engagement with non-Jewish law, conceptions of self and communal identity, messianism, the Reformations and the Thirty Years' War, mercantilism, and Jewish encounters with the Americas. The course compares Ashkenazi and Sephardi histories while rethinking the complex questions of minority belonging and exclusion.

The course will include sessions that examine previous bouts of armed conflict as well as various attempts at peace, but war and politics will not be the course's only foci; the lived experiences of Palestinians and Israelis will also receive significant attention, from historical times through the present day. These voices include a young Jewish female spy who helped the British defeat the Ottoman Empire; an Islamist rebel whose death inspired the Great Arab Revolt of the 1930s; a Holocaust survivor who fought in the 1948 war before becoming Israel's leading poet; girls whose families fled from Jerusalem and Libya, and grew up amidst poverty and war; a U.S.-trained heart surgeon-turned-PLO militant who was assassinated in his quest for peace, and many others."}

Similarly, the two terms, \"woman\" and \"law,\" are often contested terrains in regards to their respective meaning, interpreting the ways in which they have been constructed, and their roles in culture, society, and the unconscious. These moments are even more intensified in the ways they have been racialized and stand within a longer racial history of terror. To this extent, the course begins by examining the racial construction of gender and how the law becomes a tool of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender repression. It will explore cases in slave law to broaden its view on constitutional and statute law as well as other concepts of laws (e.g. psychic, notions of sexual difference, aesthetic). Throughout, attention will be given to film and media representations of law, gender, and race to consider our course explorations. The course centers black feminist thought and critical race theory as its main analytic lens, and will examine how these two intellectual and political traditions remain critical in our contemporary landscape.)"}

(In this course we will examine the underlying causes of human behavior and traits, focusing particularly on the use of quantitative genetic methods (i.e, twin and adoption studies) to disentangle genetic and environmental influences. We also will review molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes that underlie behavior. We will begin by reviewing the historical backdrop to behavior genetics, including a focus on Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, and Gregor Mendel. We will proceed to examine the use of twin and adoption studies to disentangle genetic and environmental influences, and the advantages of these methods over family studies. We will then review various molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes. We will end by exploring the results of quantitative and molecular genetic studies of various forms of psychopathology, personality, and behavior.

Because they can only exist in drawings, they are often referred to as \"paper architecture.\" But these unbuildable designs perform important roles that built ones cannot. Because they see beyond the limits of their time and circumstances, they are also known as ¿visionary architecture¿. They are free experiments, speculations, statements, illustrations, and critiques in the form of imaginary spaces. They transform design tools into unique means of analysis, thought, and representation. They explore different cultural, historical, socio-political, aesthetic, and critical dimensions of the built environment. They create unreal worlds that defy the limits of what ours can become. In this advanced studio, we will explore centuries of such incredible designs, and you will have the opportunity to create a visionary architecture of your own.

Working through historical fiction written and/or directed by women, students will study the ways in which gender, memory, trauma, and political agency are represented and redrawn in times of war. Through close readings of novels, films, and memoirs, students will explore how women's voices not only refuse dominant historical narratives, but confront the brutality of violence to demand justice and repair.

This was a particularly fruitful period for such exploration given the vast societal changes and social upheaval that took place in American society at the time and the ways in which it motivated individuals to rethink the possibilities for the various aspects of their identities. Together we will view a selection of films that illustrate the tension between these aspects of individuals' identities, with a particular focus on Individualist versus Collectivist identities.

Content: As Fabienne Kanor reflects in an interview: \"J'ai mal à mon histoire et la réécrire est le seul moyen que j'ai trouvé pour guérir un peu\" (\"My history hurts me, and rewriting it is the only way I have found to heal a little\"). This course takes up Kanor's insight as its guiding principle, exploring how artistic creation becomes a pathway to healing from historical trauma. How do artists transform pain into power? How can creativity help us heal from historical trauma and imagine new possibilities? This course invites you to explore how predominantly Black women artists and artists featuring Black women characters across the francophone world (from Senegal to Martinique, France to Vietnam, Cameroon to Reunion Island) use film, literature, poetry, performance, and visual arts as tools for healing and resistance. Through hands-on creative projects and rigorous literary and cultural analysis, you'll develop your own practice while learning concepts like \"cartographies of memory\" and \"aquatic metaphors\" as ways to understand healing journeys across the diasporas. You'll collaborate with visiting artist TIE on her project \"Odyssey in Black Utero,\" exploring how art creates healing pathways between past and future. Your final project? Create your own \"map to elsewhere\" a creative work that visualizes connections between historical memory and imagined futures. No prior art experience necessary: just curiosity and openness to creative exploration.

Content: With the study of hysteria, Freud discovered the process of repression and elaborated the concept of the unconscious. The unconscious, however, does not rest quietly. It returns to haunt the present through various disruptions that conscious thought does not know how to explain to itself: slips of the tongue, dreams, phobias, anxieties, delusions. If we learn from psychoanalysis that a past that has been repressed can return to disrupt the present, literature, for its part, has its own way of staging these uncanny returns. What comes back under the figures of the ghosts, vampires, and witches that haunt the literary stage? How do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget? These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature, psychoanalysis and film. Special attention will be given to the way psychoanalysis addresses the issue of trauma not only at the individual level but also at the collective level: transgenerational transmission of historical traumas.

No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. If journalism has historically been considered a pure and ethically-driven form of nonfiction; if, pardon the cliché, it is the first rough draft of history; if its principle motivator in this nation's history has been the pursuit of truth, justice and the American way (you did know Superman/Clark Kent was a newspaper reporter, right?); and if it is the most zealous guardian of not just any amendment to the U.S. Constitution but the First Amendment, then why is the profession of journalism historically misrepresented as crude and corrupt when Hollywood tries to tell its story? Or is the profession's purity just an old former newspaperman's misguided fantasy that confuses vice and virtue in a vocation that consumed him and his conscience for more than 35 years? Newsrooms have long been filled with quiet creative geniuses and loudmouth miscreants, the brilliant and the boorish, the talented and the tawdry, and yet there are few if any professions as tethered to, and as cognizant of, a code of ethics. What does that get you? Good fodder for screenwriters and filmmakers of feature films and documentaries at home and abroad. We'll dive into this history and have some lively assignments and discussions."}

This course will introduce you to the broad field of Developmental Biology. The fertilized egg, a single cell, gives rise to many cells that form complex multicellular organisms with many different cell types, tissues, and organs. The overall goal of developmental biology is to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes that control this amazing achievement. The study of development spans molecular biology, cell biology, genetics, embryology, and importantly, evolution. These perspectives will be used to explore general principals and fundamental mechanisms that are shared between many diverse organisms, focusing on invertebrate and vertebrate animals. This includes consideration of human development with examples of medically relevant disorders and social and ethical questions related to the field. This course fulfills the Column A requirement (or elective credit) for the Biology major. Prerequisites: Biology 142 + 142L."}

Complete Topic: Religion and the Quest for Meaning. How should we live? What and whom should we care about? What are the commitments and projects that bring purpose to our lives? These are among the most enduring and important questions humans have wrestled with, questions demanded of anyone aspiring to live a meaningful life instead of sleepwalking through it. In this course, we explore the human quest for meaning through a survey of the world's religious traditions. Religions have always been among the most reliable sources of moral ideals, and among the most successful at inculcating those ideals through the practices, communities, and narratives they provision. Yet the centrality of religion for moral formation stands in tension with the secular and pluralistic character of the world we now inhabit. In this course, we attend to the difficulties as well as the possibilities of forging connections, communities, and commitments when traditional religious outlooks are no longer widely shared or taken for granted. We also query the limits of the category of \"meaning\" by considering aspects of religion that go beyond discursive coherence, that tap into the irreducibility of human experience."}

Indeed, Roman art has often been characterized as the first truly modern art. The course will investigate the ways in which major achievements in sculpture, painting, numismatic and glyptic art, as well as architecture often reflected contemporary developments in Roman politics, society and religion. In addition the course will explore the relationship of works of art and architecture erected in the city of Rome to those in the provinces, the interaction of public and official art to domestic art, as well as the impact of art commissioned by imperial and elite patrons on that commissioned by non-elite patrons.

Vergil and Dante both became national poets in retrospect, and both conceived their great works under the profound influence of previous epic poetry. For Vergil that previous influence was primarily Homer, for Dante Vergil. Our primary goal is a close reading of both poems in their contexts, but we shall also consider how literary canons are formed, how works are re-read in later times, and what the definition of a classic is. Both works will be read in English translation, but students with knowledge of Latin or Italian or both will be invited to contribute their perspectives based on reading in the originals as well."}

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

The material for this class will be composed of novels, short stories, films, and video games. As we engage with the works of Black artists, this course will encourage us to compare forms of media and analyze the specific a¿ordances of each one. By taking this course, students can expect to gain an understanding of Black speculative fiction as a genre with a unique history that transcends individual media, reflect on Black speculative fiction as a microcosm of American culture at large, and analyze the various intersections of race, gender and sexuality which inform many of the narratives we will encounter. In response to the multi-modal nature of our course, students can expect to produce work in multiple genres and modes, including written essays, visual presentations, and interactive experiences.

A touchstone for our discussions will be the philosopher John Locke's reinvention of the human mind, in his 1690 Essay Concerning Human Understanding: \"Let us then suppose the mind to be, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be furnished?\" Locke's answer to this question, \"experience,\" had an enormous impact on the intellectual landscape of the century that followed. On the one hand, Locke's argument that our ideas are derived from the senses suggested that individuals are the products of their own experience, and thus have, in some measure, the power to shape their own lives. On the other hand, the shaping power that Locke attributed to experience conjured up the danger that our minds and our lives are always at the mercy of various external forces: including family and friends, enemies and competitors, as well as an array of social, cultural, and political settings, institutions, and ideologies. More than any other form of literary expression in the eighteenth century, the novel took up the challenge of imagining and embodying, even at times resisting, the power of experience. We will study the novels of Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, and Jane Austen, among others. Written work will include 3 essays, weekly Canvas postings, and a take-home final exam. of exams and essays"}

It is also as varied, especially in the postwar era as writers from former British colonies in Africa and the Anglophone Caribbean migrated at the government's behest to fill the void left by the loss of English soldiers in World War II. In Britain, there are many ways to be Black, and these novels lay out an array of visions. In this course we'll take a deep dive into the postwar British novel, beginning with Samuel Selvon's iconic The Lonely Londoners, which looks at the experience of the first men who were part of the Windrush generation, and finishing with Bernadine Evaristo's prize-winning epic Girl.

We are less than a century out from the genocidal devastation of the Holocaust, the birth of the State of Israel as the first independent Jewish commonwealth in almost two millennia, unprecedented freedom for Jews in many (but not all) parts of the world, and vast migrations by almost every historical Jewish community to a different part of the world than it lived in a century ago. Surely, these are features of the modern Jewish condition we will need to discuss anthropologically. We also live in an age of unprecedented technology and shifts in worldview. Can a genetic profile \"prove\" Jewishness? In what special ways are some women using assisted reproductive technology or \"reproductive tourism\" to fulfill Jewish kinship or social and religious expectations? Some of the most interesting anthropological research on Jewish communities today centers on these issues. This class takes place at a moment of increasing political polarization, including confrontations with legacies of (and contested definitions of) race, gender, and antisemitism. Do the new discussions of race and gender, as well as the politics of \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" make it harder or easier to identify and respond to key elements of the modern Jewish condition, individually or collectively? Has it grown easier or harder to answer the old question whether \"Jewishness\" is primarily a religious, ethnic, racial or national designation [spoiler: these are not the only options]? Does it matter? To whom? What is actually at stake in these conversations? Finally, we may be at something of a crossroads for the history of anthropology as a research discipline. Along with reading about the sheer diversity of ways of being, thinking, or living Jewishly, we will acknowledge the fraught Jewish history of the anthropological discipline, and ask some critical questions about its future. Is anthropology today capable, given the tools at its disposal, of rendering an adequate account of modern Jewish life? Why, for the most part, has it failed to do so (ok, that's another spoiler alert)? How has the modern Jewish condition impacted the anthropological project from its beginnings, and how might clearer thinking about Jews, Jewishness and Judaism contribute to new forms of anthropological thought? How can we read current ethnographies of Jews and Judaism critically to better understand what they tell us about the Jewish world, how they do it, and what they can learn to do better?"}

We will also probe societies and communities and their evolution over time, tracing continuity and change in women¿s legal standing, and reflecting on women and the law in modern and contemporary societies. Some of the questions we will ask include: What is the relationship between law and lived legal experiences? What strategies did women develop to navigate legal situations that affected themselves, their families, and their communities? How did they engage with marriage and divorce laws, as well as matters related to family law and inheritance? Were women involved in crime, and were there particular crimes associated with women? Did the law hinder women¿s roles in business? While this class primarily focuses on Europe, we will also examine the diverse legal standings and lived experiences of Muslim women, drawing comparisons between Europe and the Middle East, including the Ottoman Empire."}

Seminar on sociological aspects of Apollo space era (1961-1972), focusing on social and cultural aspects of four new realities: \"Spaceflight,\" \"Astronaut,\" \"Astronaut Family,\" and \"NASA.\" Students use primary source material from the Stuart A. Rose Library and the Apollo 15 Learning Hub to create final projects. Class Notes Only 12 humans have walked on the Moon; only 24 have orbited the Moon. No human has been beyond Earth's orbit since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972. The Apollo missions were extraordinary scientific achievements; they were also historical events located in particular social contexts. This seminar course takes a sociological approach to explore the Apollo era (1961-1972), focusing on four main areas: \"Spaceflight\" \"Astronaut,\" \"Astronaut Family,\" and \"NASA.\" We will begin with brief background on the political, technological, and broader social contexts of the time. Then we will delve deeper into various social and cultural aspects of these four new realities: \"Spaceflight\" (e.g., media constructions and projections), \"Astronaut\" (e.g., links to test pilot culture; gendered construction of a new occupation), \"Astronaut Family\" (e.g., relationship with the press; the unpaid work roles of wives; creating new NASA communities) and \"NASA\" (e.g., PR efforts and image constructions; early organizational culture). Students will work with primary source material from the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript and Rare Book Library, the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship's Apollo 15 Learning Hub as well as other digital archival material (from data collected by Professor Scott) to create their own projects on one of the main topic areas. Requirements: Three short research assignments that will build into a final project, in the form of an op-ed article. Drafts of the final project will be peer reviewed and discussed in class. Class attendance and discussion are integral to this course. Prerequisite: one Sociology course."}

We will therefore also use Jewish history to illuminate the histories of majority Christian societies. Students will explore themes such as expulsions, mass conversions, persecution, the print and scientific revolutions, the development of Jewish legal systems and Jewish engagement with non-Jewish law, conceptions of self and communal identity, messianism, the Reformations and the Thirty Years' War, mercantilism, and Jewish encounters with the Americas. The course compares Ashkenazi and Sephardi histories while rethinking the complex questions of minority belonging and exclusion. Students will strengthen their ability to analyze a variety of historical sources, including those produced by Jews as well as Christian sources that discuss Jewish life and culture. Students will apply their skills to write a 15-20-page research paper."}

In a society such as New Spain (Mexico) articulated around the defense and propagation of Catholic religion, religious crimes constituted a threatening subversion of the colonial discourse that justified the Spanish presence in Mexico, and a contradictory expression of the social tensions lived in the Spanish colony. This course will look at colonial society through the lens of crime by analyzing some of the main transgressions prosecuted by the Mexican Inquisition between 1520 and 1820, and the specific historical circumstances in which the trials took place. Our goal will be not only to analyze the reasons for inquisitorial repression, but also to disentangle the tensions lived in the social fabric of the colony in light of the classic divides of race, class, and gender.)"}

In this so-called era of artificial intelligence, key literary problems around creativity, humanity, and agency resonate in new and powerful ways. At the same time, AI has rapidly become a site to coalesce collective fears around increasing economic inequality, racist and sexist representations, embodiment, and environmental decay. The field of Critical AI studies examines these concerns, critiques big tech and AI development, and offers reparative alternatives for being in the age of AI. In this course, we will read literary fiction to contextualize current debates in the field of Critical AI: from data collection and surveillance to capitalism and machine bias. The semester will culminate by reading literature by writers experimenting with generative AI.

In this so-called era of artificial intelligence, key literary problems around creativity, humanity, and agency resonate in new and powerful ways. At the same time, AI has rapidly become a site to coalesce collective fears around increasing economic inequality, racist and sexist representations, embodiment, and environmental decay. The field of Critical AI studies examines these concerns, critiques big tech and AI development, and offers reparative alternatives for being in the age of AI. In this course, we will read literary fiction to contextualize current debates in the field of Critical AI: from data collection and surveillance to capitalism and machine bias. The semester will culminate by reading literature by writers experimenting with generative AI.

Hominin evolution is documented by an exceptionally rich - and ever-expanding! - fossil record, which provides evidence of remarkably diverse adaptive strategies within our lineage, as well as the evolutionary drivers of this diversity. The course is structured chronologically: we begin with the earliest putative hominins dated to 7-4 million years ago, and then examine diversity within the well-known Australopithecus genus and the enigmatic Kenyanthropus clade. Next, we consider the alternative responses to climate change evidenced by two sister groups - Homo and Paranthropus - and then continue with an in-depth exploration of the drivers of evolution and dispersals within the genus Homo. At the end of the course, students will have a strong understanding of the hominin fossil record and the state-of-the-art methods and frameworks used to understand it, but also be able to critically engage with important open questions about the evolution of our lineage.

By comparing humans to our primate cousins, the course highlights how the skeleton is reflects specializations for locomotion, diet, and aspects of life history. On the way we will explore topics like how skeletons can adapt to environmental conditions during development, and why some parts of the body can more easily evolve than others. We will trace how evolutionary tinkering with the ancestral primate body plan gave rise to the human form, where our bodies still bear signs of this shared ancestry, and how these evolutionary legacies can underlie modern health challenges. The course balances lectures with laboratory sessions. In the lab, you will gain hands-on experience with human and non-human primate skeletal material, learning to identify anatomical features, interpret functional differences, and connect them to evolutionary processes. By the end of the course, you will have developed a deep understanding of human skeletal biology and its broader links to evolution, behavior, and health."}

Whether you are a yes or a maybe, you probably aren't sure how to get started, and like many students you may be feeling intimidated or uncertain about identifying a topic, doing independent research, or getting the help you need. Seniors consistently say writing a thesis was the most rewarding experience of their undergraduate education, yet many well-qualified students miss the opportunity or give up because they started too late. If you are an honors-curious junior or sophomore in the humanities or qualitative social sciences, this class is for you! Taught in a workshop/seminar format that will create a supportive, interdisciplinary intellectual community, this class is designed to facilitate your individual exploration process and help you get a head start on your project in conversation with peers and mentors. As you identify and begin to develop your research project, you will formulate or refine your topic and methods, explore what our library has to offer, enhance your oral communication skills, and work with faculty mentors to develop a plan for success. Starting early will also enable you to identify and apply for opportunities (such as funds for travel to archives and senior research seminars) that will enhance your project and provide invaluable experience. This workshop will support you in getting started on your honors thesis and help you put together the pieces that will lead to a successful outcome in your senior year."}

As we \"map\" the histories of these two major movements, we will consider the ways artists and critics alike have constructed these movements, the relationships of these movements to each other and to Black Studies, and the processes and politics that shape notions of literary history, race, gender, sexuality, and culture in American society.)"}

Necessary? for what, and for whom? --is the poem a work of art in its own right, and how do we know, and how does that matter? --is the artwork addressed instrumentalized by the poem in any way?

How did they achieve that? But also, are such temples their only architectural achievements worth studying? This course offers a broad introduction to Greek architecture, from monumental sanctuaries and civic structures to domestic houses and everyday spaces. The course covers the essentials: architectural orders and styles, building materials, construction techniques, and the roles of architects and workshops. At the same time, it addresses broader questions, such as: How did architecture shape ritual and social life? How did thresholds, lighting, and access structure bodily encounters with the sacred? How did houses and civic buildings reflect cultural values and community identity? In collaboration with Emory's Center for Digital Scholarship, students gain experience with digital tools used to reconstruct and visualize ancient buildings not only to see how they once looked, but also to explore how design affected movement, perception, and interaction, both with the divine and among mortals. Greek architecture, approached through architectural history, classics, anthropology, and digital humanities, emerges not only as a technical achievement but also as a cultural system that structured ancient lives, shaping notions of space, community, and the sacred.

In other times, painting Buddhist subjects and visiting ancient Buddhist sites were high-minded pursuits of educated Chinese elites. Women from different social classes also found motivations to participate in the making and collecting of Buddhist art and materials.

It will be assumed that students are already familiar with the goals of linguistic inquiry and the methods of basic syntactic analysis (trees, categories, constituency tests). If you have not taken Foundations of Linguistics (LING-201/ANT-203), or an equivalent course, you will be required to do significant extra self-instructional work at the beginning of the semester. What we do in this course: Much of the language you hear over the course of a day consists of sentences you have never heard before, and yet you are able to understand them. How is this possible? The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its words and the way they are combined. In the first part of this course, students will learn a system for doing just this - combining phrase structure trees and computing the meanings that result, using the formal language of predicate logic to represent sentence meanings. Then, in the second part of the course, we'll focus on utterance meaning - aspects of meaning that go beyond what is shown in the predicate logic. For example, what enables us to understand a sentence like `There's ice cream on your shirt' as a simple informative description in some contexts, as an accusation in others, and as a warning in still others? We'll discuss speech acts, implicature, presupposition and other aspects of utterance meaning as we explore the close relationship between semantics and pragmatics. All required readings will be made available online."}

As you grapple with how to portray a version of yourself and the commitments you've developed from your experiences, we will take a metadisciplinary and rhetorical approach to this representation. We will reflect on how you have learned to create meaning in your fields and communities, in terms of what you have been taught to value and come to value personally in your scholarship. Moreover, you will practice using writing and speech to show this approach to others who may or may not have the same backgrounds as you do.

And what role do images play in shaping how societies portray, classify, and engage with those deemed alien, foreign, or other? Across the ancient Mediterranean, peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece with their different languages, religions, skin colors, and traditions shared spaces, traded, exchanged ideas, and forged alliances, but also fought, invaded, and enslaved one another. How did these interactions, both peaceful and violent, influence the ways they depicted one another as foreigners, neighbors, defeated enemies, and racialized others? And how did such ideologically and culturally charged representations, in turn, shape lived encounters between different populations? This course draws on visual, material, and literary evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece (ca. 18004 00 BCE) to examine the role of ethnic and racial representation in constructing power dynamics and shaping human relations in the ancient world. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and direct engagement with the Greek, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian collections at the Carlos Museum, students will critically analyze how visual and textual sources depicted foreignness, difference, and otherness, and how these depictions structured broader patterns of cultural interaction, political authority, and social hierarchy.

While such work is imminently important, this course looks at how humans have related to and interacted with mountains in literature and film. Beginning with climbing documentaries such as Free Solo, we discuss the increasing popularity of rock and gym climbing to investigate how previous mountaineers and inhabitants of mountain regions have depicted their forays. We conclude by looking at future challenges and opportunities of mountain sports. Through narratives and film, group projects and personal explorations of local places and communities, this course pursues the question of what are the promises of outdoor recreation and what are its pitfalls."}

As part of this, we will compare typical pronunciations of Spanish with those of English, and we will examine how different communities assign different social meanings and values to different pronunciations (for instance, why and in what circumstances do people value positively or negatively pronunciations such as \"ello están contento\" as opposed to \"ellos están contentos\"). This semester, we will include a component focusing on how different pronunciations and intonation can contribute to the performance of literary, theatrical and other spoken-language texts/events. TEXT: Tuten, D. N., Tejedo-Herrero, L. F., R. Rao, & H. R. Clarke. 2022. Pronunciaciones del español (Routledge). PARTICULARS: This course is designed for a wide variety of students, including those for whom Spanish is a primary/native or heritage language as well as for those who are learning Spanish as a second language. This is an introductory course in Hispanic Linguistics and therefore no background in Linguistics is required. Span/Ling 303 is a core course for the Spanish and Linguistics Joint Major and a Foundational Course for the Spanish Major and Minor. It counts as an elective or HAL course for other Linguistics majors and minors. EVALUATION is based on attendance/participation, homework assignments, exams, and performance projects. PREREQUISITE: SPAN 212 or an Official Spanish Placement into our Foundational Course level (Span 300-318). Take the online Spanish Placement Exam at http://spanport.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/placement/index.html. For more information on Foundational Courses, please go to www.spanport.emory.edu."}

How do we display aspects of our identity in spoken and written texts? How do speakers exert institutional power over others in interactions? How do speaker belief systems shape discourse and how dos discourse reinforce belief systems? This course will introduce students to the ways that conversation, narrative, and language variation function in naturally occurring language data. Students will also learn the practical aspects of collecting and transcribing speech and we will review theoretical debates for how to relate the details of spoken and written \"texts\" to broader social categories such as power, identity, culture, and speaker roles."}

A central question during the ancient period will be, what was \"Judaism\" and how did it emerge out of the diverse religious landscape of antiquity? The medieval period will focus on the interface between Jewish communities and the states or empires in which they lived. Particular attention will be paid to the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslim peoples and cultures. In the modern period, we will analyze the processes by which governments, politicians and some segments of Jews attempted to incorporate the Jews and Judaism into European society and the various problems and reactions engendered by the quest for Jewish emancipation and social integration."}

It will focus especially on schooling inequalities according to racial, ethnic, immigrant, class, gender, and sexual status, as measured by educational achievement and attainment, and which are often inherent to the structures and processes of U.S. schooling. The course also examines the interconnection of schooling to important social institutions, such as families, and their contribution to schooling inequality.

This course explores the origins, dynamic growth, and near destruction of East European Jewry from the Middle Ages to the Holocaust and the challenges to Jewish life in this region in the post-WWII era. Many of the signature features of modern Jewish life - Hasidism, modern Jewish literature, Yiddish, Zionism, revolutionary socialism - derive from the centuries-long robust Jewish civilization in Eastern Europe.) (This course will make extensive use of primary documents - legal charters, memoirs, Hasidic tales, short stories, war reportage - to give us the tools to reconstruct this history together. We will also watch films and critically assess the recent Broadway versions of Fiddler on the Roof. As an add-on to this course, there is an optional 1-credit, twelve-day travel course to Poland, \"Jews of Poland: History and Memory\", which will be offered in May 2026.)"}

In doing this, we will think deeply about how humanity defines itself through and against its own narratives of power and dominance. -Where are we going? In addressing this question, we will attempt to work through some of the largest existential threats to humankind and determine two things: How do different disciplines tackle these issues? And can these disciplines work together to solve them?"}

And what role do images play in shaping how societies portray, classify, and engage with those deemed alien, foreign, or other? Across the ancient Mediterranean, peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece with their different languages, religions, skin colors, and traditions shared spaces, traded, exchanged ideas, and forged alliances, but also fought, invaded, and enslaved one another. How did these interactions, both peaceful and violent, influence the ways they depicted one another as foreigners, neighbors, defeated enemies, and racialized others? And how did such ideologically and culturally charged representations, in turn, shape lived encounters between different populations? This course draws on visual, material, and literary evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece (ca. 18004 00 BCE) to examine the role of ethnic and racial representation in constructing power dynamics and shaping human relations in the ancient world. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and direct engagement with the Greek, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian collections at the Carlos Museum, students will critically analyze how visual and textual sources depicted foreignness, difference, and otherness, and how these depictions structured broader patterns of cultural interaction, political authority, and social hierarchy.

Be his fellow-worker and his accomplice.\" In this course we will become the accomplices of one of the most inventive writers of twentieth-century literature. Reading our way through some of Woolf's major novels as well as selected essays, stories, and autobiographical writing, we will think about Woolf as a critic, humorist, feminist, and literary innovator, with special consideration to the way Woolf reinvents representations of character and human consciousness. While we focus on Woolf's illuminations of the interior self, we will also explore the adventurous artistic and philosophical spirit of Bloomsbury and how her work reflects England's transformation in the first half of the twentieth century: world war and its aftermath, changing social and sexual mores, new conceptions of gender roles and women's rights, advances in human psychology, and contemporaneous developments in painting and design. Texts may include some of the following: Woolf, Night and Day, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, Between the Acts; The Waves; A Room of One's Own; Forster, Maurice; Bowen, The House in Paris; Mansfield, stories; Watson, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day.

Topics include the extent and limits of generosity, the proper objects of loving-kindness and compassion, the moral consequences of truths and falsehoods, and mind-training techniques for taking obstacles as the path.)
