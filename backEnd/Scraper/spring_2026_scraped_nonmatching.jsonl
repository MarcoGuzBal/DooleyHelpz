Why do we need to think of humanity as a problem? -Human compared to what? Here we seek to further illustrate what makes humanity distinct through a comparative lens. What is a human compared to an animal, a robot, or even, considering our strange relationship to the nation-state, a citizen? In doing this, we will think deeply about how humanity defines itself through and against its own narratives of power and dominance. -Where are we going? In addressing this question, we will attempt to work through some of the largest existential threats to humankind and determine two things: How do different disciplines tackle these issues? And can these disciplines work together to solve them?"}

And what role do images play in shaping how societies portray, classify, and engage with those deemed alien, foreign, or other? Across the ancient Mediterranean, peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece with their different languages, religions, skin colors, and traditions shared spaces, traded, exchanged ideas, and forged alliances, but also fought, invaded, and enslaved one another. How did these interactions, both peaceful and violent, influence the ways they depicted one another as foreigners, neighbors, defeated enemies, and racialized others? And how did such ideologically and culturally charged representations, in turn, shape lived encounters between different populations? This course draws on visual, material, and literary evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece (ca. 18004 00 BCE) to examine the role of ethnic and racial representation in constructing power dynamics and shaping human relations in the ancient world. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and direct engagement with the Greek, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian collections at the Carlos Museum, students will critically analyze how visual and textual sources depicted foreignness, difference, and otherness, and how these depictions structured broader patterns of cultural interaction, political authority, and social hierarchy.

Be his fellow-worker and his accomplice.\" In this course we will become the accomplices of one of the most inventive writers of twentieth-century literature. Reading our way through some of Woolf's major novels as well as selected essays, stories, and autobiographical writing, we will think about Woolf as a critic, humorist, feminist, and literary innovator, with special consideration to the way Woolf reinvents representations of character and human consciousness. While we focus on Woolf's illuminations of the interior self, we will also explore the adventurous artistic and philosophical spirit of Bloomsbury and how her work reflects England's transformation in the first half of the twentieth century: world war and its aftermath, changing social and sexual mores, new conceptions of gender roles and women's rights, advances in human psychology, and contemporaneous developments in painting and design. Texts may include some of the following: Woolf, Night and Day, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, Between the Acts; The Waves; A Room of One's Own; Forster, Maurice; Bowen, The House in Paris; Mansfield, stories; Watson, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day.

Topics include the extent and limits of generosity, the proper objects of loving-kindness and compassion, the moral consequences of truths and falsehoods, and mind-training techniques for taking obstacles as the path.)
