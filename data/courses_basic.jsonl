The course addresses several tensions and issues that affect the practice of community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to overcome these obstacles to foster social change comprehensively (e.g., reduce poverty and promote economic mobility) as well as within specific policy domains such as education, economic development, workforce development, health, and the environment, among others. We will explore the course material through lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of comprehensive community initiatives launched over the past 30 years.

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research) (This is not an introductory course on the conflict. Those interested in an introductory course should enroll in the larger \"Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\" course to be taught in Spring 2026)"}

Quite obviously, the reality is considerably more complicated. This class will take you through a century of canonical African American writers exploring Black desire, from Race Men and Club Women extolling the virtues of racial uplift to satirists gleefully calling attention to our very human foibles, and all those in between, puzzling over the complexity of being both human and symbol, hero and villain in the world's imagination. Through mini-lectures, small group analysis and full class discussions, we will take on the provocative yet rewarding challenges these essays and novels bequeath to us. To what degree does our social identity as African American restrict, mediate or perhaps heighten our desires? When our safety, livelihoods, and dignity are always under assault, how do our desires protect us or expose us further? Course work will include 10 written reader reactions, one midterm paper of 1250 words and one final paper of 2500 words. Attendance and participation in discussion also required. (SAME AAS 262W-1)"}

Nineteenth-century British writers were intensely interested in this question, at a time when the British Empire was engaged in a project of defining the ideal citizen and distinguishing that person from its other subjects. One critical medium for creating and challenging conceptions of personhood was literature. In this course, we will explore the tangled problem of who counts as a \"person\" , then and now, by examining Victorian literature's encounters with all manner of deviant creatures: monsters, matriarchs, sex workers, and children; the enslaved, the laboring, and the queer; a Galapagos tortoise and a beloved wombat. We will intersperse poetry, non-fiction prose, and novels with (gentle) introductions to the critical and theoretical perspectives that will help us ask good questions of our readings, questions about race, empire, gender, sexuality, class, and ecology. Ultimately, we will return to our framing query: in what ways do we remain in the shadow of the nineteenth century's definition of personhood, and what are the consequences of this inheritance for us now?)

Much of the work on archival theory to date has been in interrogating the role of archives in state formation and in the construction of national histories. This course shifts focus to the materiality of the documents, objects, buildings, and people constitutive of the archive. In what ways are poems and stories entangled with institutions of culture? Why do literary texts take the material forms that they do? How might exploring an author's correspondence, drafts, periodical publications, or limited editions affect how we interpret their work? This course focuses on African and African diaspora, Irish, and postcolonial writers whose literary archives are held in Emory's Stuart A. Rose Library or who have left traces in its collections. Expanding our sense of what constitutes an archive, we will consider the ways in which institutions have the power to privilege and marginalize, as well as preserve and promote. Writers may include Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Agha Shahid Ali, Lucille Clifton, Lorna Goodison, Seamus Heaney, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill (in translation), Christopher Okigbo, Natasha Trethewey, and W. B.

We will engage with fiction writing as always about creating human beings with histories, bodies, and social realities; as always about creating a world anew for an audience; and as always a form of communication with an ongoing humanity -- be it dead writers, current beloveds, future anonymous readers or one's own self. Students will come to understand the fiction workshop as a place to face fears, biases and the limitations of the imagination all via practice and hard work. Students will come to see fiction as a place to communicate as writers and critics. Students come to see fiction writing and critical reading as a place to engage bravely and vulnerably with grief, joy and the full range of human emotions between.

How might we maintain a short story's necessary \"intensity of focus\" within a timeframe that spans centuries? How might a short story that takes place over the course of an hour give every detail heightened significance? In addition to exploring the narrative pressures of different timeframes, we will look at stories that break linearity, gesturing toward the future and even using elements like time travel to negotiate the constraints of the short story form. Selections from contemporary short fiction authors like Venita Blackburn, Sean Vestal, Mariah Rigg, Jonathan Escoffery, Brenda Peynado, Steven Millhauser, Ted Chiang, and Sofia Samatar will be included in our studies.

Through the shared sense of trust and endeavor provided by the workshop community, we will closely read the work of published poets and that of our peers as we draft new poems ourselves. To structure our in-class discussions and the weekly creation of new work, we will look closely at prosody and the resurgence of traditional forms in the work of contemporary American poets.

That truth is then brought to an audience to react, decide, reflect, and revolt. Plays are a singular democratic practice and gift in the human experience. Every single one of us has brilliant plays inside us, stories that connect others and help people feel alive, but how do we tell them? How do you figure out and access your truth - but more importantly, how can you make your truth legible to the outside world? In Intermediate Playwriting, we will be learning various elements of the craft, voyaging over a century worth of American playwrights to learn different tools and techniques, but more importantly for you to access what excites you and what themes you'd like your work to be in conversation with. In breaking down literary texts and exploring theatrical history, I often pose the central questions: What makes a play a play? What is theatricality? By investigating the foundations of story and identifying the elements that make a text theatrical, students develop a deeper understanding of both the craft and the medium. We will do this over a series of multiple exercises, and you will write a one-act play. Permission of the department required."}

This is nonfiction. Be prepared to be a reporter, to meet people face-to-face, to ask questions, to see and hear things with your own eyes and ears. My goal is to get your work published. We'll have visiting experts on hand as we discuss where great ideas come from, how to be strategic in your reporting, the art of the interview, and crafting stories, then stories within stories. We're looking mostly at print, but we will see beyond the dead tree media at the growing opportunities for magazine-style writing and long-form narratives online. Ultimately, the goal of the course is for you to become a considerably wiser and more effective nonfiction storyteller, for which the basis is sound reporting.

In the years between 1945 and 1968, untold numbers of American citizens were targeted for death because of their race, beliefs, or civil rights work - and in some cases merely because of what they drove, how they spoke, or the ever-shifting lines of racial etiquette they crossed. In many cases, their murders were inadequately investigated or prosecuted, their stories left untold, and the crimes against their humanity never punished. The Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project at Emory University is both a class and an ongoing historical and journalistic exploration of the Jim Crow South through the prism of unsolved or unpunished civil rights-era murders in Georgia.

No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. If journalism has historically been considered a pure and ethically-driven form of nonfiction; if, pardon the cliché, it is the first rough draft of history; if its principle motivator in this nation's history has been the pursuit of truth, justice and the American way (you did know Superman/Clark Kent was a newspaper reporter, right?); and if it is the most zealous guardian of not just any amendment to the U.S. Constitution but the First Amendment, then why is the profession of journalism historically misrepresented as crude and corrupt when Hollywood tries to tell its story? Or is the profession's purity just an old former newspaperman's misguided fantasy that confuses vice and virtue in a vocation that consumed him and his conscience for more than 35 years? Newsrooms have long been filled with quiet creative geniuses and loudmouth miscreants, the brilliant and the boorish, the talented and the tawdry, and yet there are few if any professions as tethered to, and as cognizant of, a code of ethics. What does that get you? Good fodder for screenwriters and filmmakers of feature films and documentaries at home and abroad. We'll dive into this history and have some lively assignments and discussions. Permission of the department required."}

They will also produce final papers that document the results of their research.Participating students should have some familiarity with Python or a willingness to learn.)"}

(Technical Writing for Data Science - In this writing-intensive course, we will practice the effective and ethical communication of specialized technical knowledge and quantitative data. Because data are information given order, we will consider their arrangement and re-arrangement as rhetoric. We will introduce rhetorical analysis as a model for understanding how quantitative data can be interpreted and conveyed for multiple audiences that range from professional researchers to the lay public. Guided by this knowledge, you will exercise strategies for communicating via the text, speech, and visual conventions that are integral to preparing \"technical\" genres such as research reports, research translations, informative and persuasive infographics, instructions, and data repositories. We will adapt these genres and their conventions for our course goals that center collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, while emphasizing the methodological questions to ask when bringing new purposes to data prepared by others, as well as whom to ask, and how. As you gain comfort with thinking of writing and analysis as intertwined practices of exploratory inquiry, we will focus especially on how these practices shape the social impacts of our data-driven narratives.)

(Suffering is a universal feature of human life. No one who lives does not also suffer. This insight is the starting point for the Buddha's teachings on the nature of the human condition and the possibility of human flourishing. Although suffering is universal, diverse causes of suffering can be identified. Once identified, these causes can be ameliorated so that the suffering they produce is either less harmful or even eliminated. Humans can learn how to live with suffering and to transform it into something beautiful, just as a gardener uses manure to nourish beautiful flowers. To turn suffering into a path of well-being, however, requires many skills. We need to learn how to look deeply to see the complex causes of suffering. Then we need to learn to see how these causes can be ameliorated or even undone. We also need to train in the methods for ameliorating and undoing the causes of suffering. These methods require work at the personal as well as the communal levels, at the surface as well as the deeper levels of our embodied minds. This course is an introduction to traditional and contemporary Buddhist theories of well-being, happiness, and flourishing, along with some of the methods designed to bring these about.)"}

Students will become familiar with major sociological, anthropological and hermeneutic approaches which pursue questions about the function, origin, comparison and language of religion. We will explore key terms in the contemporary study of religion such as culture, body, performance, rationality. Throughout, we will be concerned with the ways in which the category of religion has been and continues to be constructed by those who study it.

To request permission to register, contact Prof. Wei Wu wei.wu@emory.edu Law school schedule: Th 2pm-4:30pm LAW 831A emphasizes the production of scholarly writing in the form of a seminar paper. To support the success of undergraduate students enrolled in the course, an additional writing workshop component is included for undergraduate students. Undergraduate students enrolled in the cross-listed course number REL 371 for LAW 831A will meet with the instructor for 30 minutes at the conclusion of each class to discuss expectations, best practices, and strategies for scholarly research and writing. Graduate and professional students enrolled in LAW831A are also invited to join the discussion. For this reason, while LAW 831A is scheduled from 2pm - 4pm on Thursdays, the cross-listed course number will be scheduled from 2pm - 4:30pm. In recent years there has been much attention on the idea of sanctuary as a form of protection for immigrants and refugees threatened with deportation both among religious communities and municipalities. These movements have proven controversial and efforts are presently underway to undermine the ability of both religious communities and sanctuary jurisdictions to offer protection to immigrants and refugees. This seminar will examine the idea of sanctuary from its origins in ancient and medieval religious practices, through the sanctuary movement of the 1980s, and the advent of sanctuary jurisdictions. The seminar will also examine asylum law and its connections with the idea of sanctuary, recent policy decisions to allow immigration enforcement actions in religious spaces, and the application of religious free exercise protections to persons charged with illegal actions taken in support of immigrants and refugees. Students will write a seminar paper engaging broadly with the concepts of sanctuary, protection, and migration.

In this seminar course, students will explore Jewish civilization through a focus on Jewish foodways: what Jews eat and don't eat, and why; how various Jewish identities are connected with food; the role of food (and drink) in celebration and mourning; how Jews have adopted and adapted foods in their global dispersion and in the modern State of Israel; Jewish contributions to non-Jewish food cultures. While some basic knowledge of Judaism and Jewish culture will be helpful, no such prior knowledge is strictly required. Students will engage with the work of the course from diverse knowledge backgrounds and identities (Jewish and non-Jewish)."}

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research) This is not an introductory course on the conflict.

The course queries how presupposed notions of language, communication, narrative, media, and the like provide implicit foundations for producing and naturalizing notions of health, disease, medicine, and the body and their associated practices and materialities. Topics covered include narrative production; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; narratives of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.)

Students will examine how various family formats are portrayed on film, and to what extent they construe, challenge, and/or otherwise reproduce influential concepts (such as care, work, motherhood, childhood, decency, masculinity, or promiscuity) across gender, racial, and/or class-based lines. In examining these issues, we will look at how People of Color, Women, Children, and members of the LGBTQ+ collective bear the brunt of abuse and generalized violence brought against them due to the sheer fact that they dare to exist. We will also explore the concept of patriarchy paying attention to the many traits that turn masculinity in particular, and cisheteronormativity in general, (as well as subtle forms of white supremacy-ism) into vigilance vectors bent on building \"the normal\". In analyzing narrative depictions that address the aforementioned forms of inequality, the class will discuss to what extent State-sponsored forms of violence manufacture hegemony, neutralizing and destroying any detectable \"deviance\" from a desideratum for docile and malleable citizens that remains under constant (de)construction.

We will periodically face the question `How are words different from sentences?' and in the second part of the course we will examine this question in-depth by looking at some problematic cases in English and other languages.

Drawing on a number of classic and contemporary texts, we consider both the specificity of local medical narratives and the processes, which increasingly link these systems of knowledge and practice. The course queries how presupposed notions of language, communication, narrative, media, and the like provide implicit foundations for producing and naturalizing notions of health, disease, medicine, and the body and their associated practices and materialities. Topics covered include narrative production; local theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; narratives of embodiment; medicalization; structural violence; the meanings and effects of new medical technologies; and global health.) Texts: Provided by instructor. Prerequisites: At least one foundational course (SPAN 300- 318) or permission from instructor"}

Students will learn about the linguistics characteristics of the different Spanish varieties spoken by these communities, including phonetic, morphological, syntactic and lexical aspects. Special attention is given to the relationship between language and society, particularly on topics such as ethnic and cultural identity, multilingualism and language policy. The course also presents a theoretical and practical approach to the ethnographic research method. Students will read and analyze studies carried out by different scholars and will design their own research project on the topic of their preference. Special attention is given to ethical principles, for this reason students will need to complete the web-based Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) Program in the Protection of Human Subjects in Research. Background on general Linguistics is recommended, such as the one provided in Span/Ling 303, Span/Ling 304 or Ling 201.This course meets the sociocultural requirement of the Linguistics Major and can be used as one of the required 400-level courses for the Joint Major in Spanish & Linguistics or for the Major/Minor in Spanish. TEXTS: - Escobar, Anna María and Kim Potowski. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. - Selection of articles available in Canvas. EVALUATION: Evaluation will be based in class participation, weekly assignments, one exam, one research project and five written practices. PRE-REQUISITES: One foundational course, preferably SPAN/LING 303 or SPAN/LING 304."}

It is a 4-credits course, fulfilling the writing requirement with extensive weekly writing. The course does NOT require any prerequisites or prior knowledge of computational tools. Freshmen are not allowed to register. Text corpora will be assigned for analysis but students are welcome to use their own texts (e,g., newspaper articles, books, blogs). The course is based on a set of specialized Natural Language Processing tools (NLP), written in Python, designed for the analysis of small/large corpora of text. The tools come with an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI). From sentence splitter, to tokenizer, lemmatizer, parser with its Part-of-Speech tags (POSTAG), Dependency Relations (DEPREL), Named Entity Recognition (NER), semantic trees, sentence complexity and text readability, noun and verb analysis, n-grams viewer, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, extraction of SVOs (Subject-Verb-Object), and shape of stories, word embeddings (Word2Vec) you will learn the language of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The course also embeds tools of data visualization as word clouds, Excel-type charts, network graphs, and Geographic Information System (GIS) maps. The course uses freeware software exclusively. The course has no required books."}

In these interviews, we will target specific linguistic characteristics, inquire about language attitudes, and elicit natural speech. You will learn about the sociolinguistic interview process, develop skills working with linguistic corpora, and study other relevant topics within linguistics to inform your work on the project. This course will also allow students to formulate and address a research question of their choosing. Course is open to students of all years and skill levels.

Students will meet weekly to learn about specialty coffee and collectively support coffee growers from Guatemala and Honduras. In the first four meetings, students will read about and discuss issues related to specialty coffee and storytelling. Then, students will be introduced to participating coffee growers. During each 3-Day Storytelling Workshop, students will work with growers to cultivate a deeper appreciation for how effective farm stories can enhance economic opportunities. In the post-workshop meetings, students will continue to work with their assigned growers to complete, review, and refine their stores. Completed stories will be posted on a dedicated website.

While most people list happiness as one of their central life goals, people are surprisingly bad at knowing what will make them happy. In this course, we will explore what science can tell us about what actually makes people happy both personally and professionally. We will begin by examining how scientists define and measure happiness and some of the benefits of happiness for individuals and organizations. Next, we will examine the features of our minds that often make us less happy and how to combat them. We will then turn to what science can teach us about how to be happier, less stressed, and more fulfilled in our personal and professional lives. Students will have multiple opportunities to put these practices into action and will be encouraged to develop ways to build them into their current and future lives."}

This class proposes a guided visit through six centuries of fascination for debris, remains, rubbles, wreckage, and life in the aftermaths. Taught in French."}

Content: While personal narratives that blend fact and fiction existed well before the term autofiction was coined in 1977, in this course we will consider the reasons why this genre has become ubiquitous in French and Francophone cultural and literary spheres of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will focus on the genre's flexibility and capacity to 1) communicate individual experiences as they relate to powerful, painful, and liberating social, political, and historical events and 2) communicate the complexity of these experiences not just through writing but across different media including graphic novels, photography, film, music, interviews, and social media.

FREN 488. Hauntings: Literature, Psychoanalysis, Film Prof. Claire Nouvet / Mondays and Wednesdays, 1:00-2:15PM. Content: With the study of hysteria, Freud discovered the process of repression and elaborated the concept of the unconscious. The unconscious, however, does not rest quietly. It returns to haunt the present through various disruptions that conscious thought does not know how to explain to itself: slips of the tongue, dreams, phobias, anxieties, delusions. If we learn from psychoanalysis that a past that has been repressed can return to disrupt the present, literature, for its part, has its own way of staging these uncanny returns. What comes back under the figures of the ghosts, vampires, and witches that haunt the literary stage? How do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget? These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature, psychoanalysis and film. Special attention will be given to the way psychoanalysis addresses the issue of trauma not only at the individual level but also at the collective level: transgenerational transmission of historical traumas. Texts may include: Freud: Introductory Lectures [selections] Studies in Hysteria [selections] Delusion and Dream in Wilhelm Jensen's Gradiva Balzac: Adieu Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly: Diaboliques Duras: Hiroshima, mon amour [film] Gauthier: Arria Marcella Michelet: La Sorcière Davoine and Gaudillard: History Beyond Trauma [selections]"}

What expectations might visitors to American or European museums and galleries have about art by an artist specifically identified with the continent of Africa? And how might expectations change if the art were not presented with a qualifier that linked the artist or the work to the continent? Answers to such questions impact where in a museum we might find an artist's work and how a museum might present the work. The course requires no previous study of the continent of Africa or African art. We will focus on arts created for worldwide audiences by diverse artists linked to different areas of the African continent. We will look at, read about, discuss, write about, and otherwise reflect upon a range of works in order to think about what various labels reveal and conceal about art, identity, and experience in national and transnational contexts.

This course provides students with the essential tools to analyze and interpret this data, empowering them to think critically about the strengths and challenges of quantitative methods in anthropology. In this hands-on course, students will dive into the core quantitative techniques used in anthropological research. With a focus on data collection, analysis, and interpretation, you'll gain practical experience applying statistical tools to real-world anthropological data. We'll go beyond theory to help you develop essential data analysis skills that you can use in any setting. The course combines lectures, interactive computer labs, and group discussions. Lectures will introduce key statistical concepts, while lab sessions provide the opportunity to put these concepts into practice using R statistical software. In group discussions, you'll collaborate with classmates to refine your analytical skills and deepen your understanding of how quantitative methods can be applied to anthropological questions. By the end of the course, you'll feel confident in using quantitative approaches to explore and answer the complex questions at the heart of anthropological research.

Simultaneously, increased calls to decolonize ethnographic research and produce work for wider publics are leading to increased experimentation with ethnographic research design and genres of research dissemination. This advanced seminar examines these developments, and provides a workshop setting for students to produce their own projects, based on original research. We will explore modes of social science and humanistic experimentation, and we will evaluate projects for their impact, ethics, and relevance. Students will examine and practice a variety of ethnographic methods for gathering data and documenting the human condition in different genres, including multimodal, multisensorial, and performance-based formats. Requirements include: Preparation for each class day, active participation in discussions, short assignments, and a team project based on original ethnographic research.

Students will learn how contemporary anthropologists are engaged in a range of theater making initiatives, forging new connections and engagements across techniques, traditions, and stakeholders. We will explore -- and practice -- the crafts of transitioning between ethnographic research, scriptwriting, acting, and staging. Our questions include: How does the ethnographer vividly convey the textures of life? How is analysis integrated with description? How are embodiment, affect, and multisensorial experiences documented ethnographically -- and conveyed through performance modalities? What are the ethical and moral responsibilities and implications of this kind of work? What are its political and liberatory potentialities? Students will develop skills through fieldwork exercises, movement techniques, theater games, and physical theater methods.

For decades, studies on primate behavior have provided us with a lens to observe our ancestral past. Since the onset of the discipline, primatology has continued to evolve, with the integration of novel methodologies that have placed studies on primate behavior at the forefront of anthropology, social sciences, animal behavior, psychology, and medicine. This seminar focuses on the past, present, and future of primatology by examining the discipline's theoretical roots and the groundbreaking studies that address current problems in primate behavior and primate cognition. By reading and discussing both novel studies and \"old\" seminal scientific papers, this course will challenge you to understand historical perspectives, consider theoretical advances, examine methodological approaches, and critically assess the future trajectories of primatology."}

As part of this, we will compare typical pronunciations of Spanish with those of English, and we will examine how different communities assign different social meanings and values to different pronunciations (for instance, why and in what circumstances do people value positively or negatively pronunciations such as \"ello están contento\" as opposed to \"ellos están contentos\"). This semester, we will include a component focusing on how different pronunciations and intonation can contribute to the performance of literary, theatrical and other spoken-language texts/events. TEXT: Tuten, D. N., Tejedo-Herrero, L. F., R. Rao, & H. R. Clarke. 2022. Pronunciaciones del español (Routledge). PARTICULARS: This course is designed for a wide variety of students, including those for whom Spanish is a primary/native or heritage language as well as for those who are learning Spanish as a second language. This is an introductory course in Hispanic Linguistics and therefore no background in Linguistics is required. Span/Ling 303 is a core course for the Spanish and Linguistics Joint Major and a Foundational Course for the Spanish Major and Minor. It counts as an elective or IC/HAL course for other Linguistics majors and minors. ***If SPAN 303 is at full capacity, please consider enrolling in LING 304, which will satisfy the same major requirements and the IC requirement.*** EVALUATION is based on attendance/participation, homework assignments, exams, and performance projects. PREREQUISITE: SPAN 212, permission of instructor or an Official Spanish Placement into our Foundational Course level (Span 300-318).

Why don't we ask, \"Your hair do like you like that?\" 2. Does like have the same meaning in both uses? 3. Are the r's in \"Deborah\" and \"hair\" pronounced the same? 4. Who asked the question, and does it matter? Is the utterance really even a question? 5. How does our interpretation change if we know more about the tone of the utterance? The answers to these questions and others similar are what we'll explore in Span/ Ling 304, starting with a general history of the field of linguistics and what human communication entails before moving into detailed discussions of the production and organization of the sounds of Spanish (fonética y fonología); the formation, structure, and meanings of words (morfología); the structure and organization of sentences (sintaxis); analyses of meaning of words, sentences and conversations (semántica y pragmática); and examples of linguistic variation.

Centering on representations of Madrid, Barcelona, and New York sites of exchange and circulation among Spaniards, Latin Americans, and Latinxs we will ask: how are real cities imagined or remembered by those who live, visit, or immigrate there? How does the city map performances of social class, gender/sexuality, and ethnicity? Readings will draw from a variety of genres: memoirs, short stories, essays, poetry, film, theater, and websites.

In examining these issues, we will look at how People of Color, Women, Children, and members of the LGBTQ+ collective bear the brunt of abuse and generalized violence brought against them due to the sheer fact that they dare to exist. We will also explore the concept of patriarchy paying attention to the many traits that turn masculinity in particular, and cisheteronormativity in general, (as well as subtle forms of white supremacy-ism) into vigilance vectors bent on building \"the normal\".

How are embodiment, affect, and multisensorial experiences documented ethnographically -- and conveyed through performance modalities? What are the ethical and moral responsibilities and implications of this kind of work? What are its political and liberatory potentialities?

Part of what makes German Romanticism unique is its blending of the philosophical and the poetic/literary in its quest for a language and form adequate to, or at least resonant with, what it seeks to present: the \"Absolute.\" In this course, we will focus on the themes of system & fragment, romantic irony, the native/foreign opposition, conceptions of the feminine, and the problem of evil, reading Schlegel, Tieck, Hölderlin, Günderrode, Novalis, and Schelling, on the one hand, each supplemented by a reading from Blanchot, De Man, Heidegger, Wolf, Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, and Zizek, respectively, on the other.

In the first section, we will read general accounts of technological experience and technological objects by Martin Heidegger, Gilbert Simondon, and Yuk Hui. In the second, we will turn to the question of human-machine interaction and symbiosis in Plato, Ernst Kapp, Ernst Jünger, and Donna Haraway. In the third section, we will look at the emergence of cybernetics and the philosophy of information in N. Katherine Hayle, Norbet Wiener, and Raymond Ruyer. Finally, we will examine classic and contemporary debates about artificial intelligence and human consciousness in Hubert Dreyfus, Jean-François Lyotard, and several contemporary authors (to be determined).

Our focus will be on understanding how, why, and to what effects, collaborative, community-based, cross-sector (public-private-nonprofit) initiatives are crafted. The course addresses several tensions and issues that affect the practice of community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to overcome these obstacles to foster social change comprehensively (e.g., reduce poverty and promote economic mobility) as well as within specific policy domains such as education, economic development, workforce development, health, and the environment, among others. We will explore the course material through lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of comprehensive community initiatives launched over the past 30 years. This course is a requirement for participation in Emory's Community Building and Social Change Fellows Program, though students do not need to commit to participating in the CBSC program to enroll.

{"code": "MATH 385", "title": "Topics in Mathematics: Problem-Solving Strategies", "credits": "3", "typically_offered": "", "ger": "", "requirement_sentence": "One of the key skills for anyone engaged in fields such as programming and mathematics is the ability to solve challenging problems. In most mathematics courses such as Calculus, the majority of problems follow standard solution algorithms and require a minimal set of ideas. Unfortunately, within the framework of such courses, instructors are often reluctant to challenge students with difficult problems. However, if you are interested in mathematics --- especially if you see it as your major, a potential career path, or even if you wish to participate in mathematical or coding competitions --- it is crucial to develop strong problem-solving skills. As is often the case, the only time-tested approach to mastering this skill is to tackle new mathematical problems. The goal of this course is to introduce and practice with a wide range of ideas, techniques, and methods that can aid in this endeavor. As the name of this course suggests, there will be a significant emphasis on problem-solving practice. Some of these problems will be taken directly from competitions such as PUTNAM or the International Mathematical Olympiads. Other problems might serve as lemmas in a research paper. Our aim is to `merge' these two approaches, the competitive and the exploratory. Prerequisites: Math 250 or equivalent Please email MATH-REGISTRATION@LISTSERV.CC.EMORY.EDU for permission.

This seminar will examine how, exactly, this land has been discussed in international forums and in various countries, as well as how leaders of both Israelis and Palestinians have worked to chart a foreign policy for their respective peoples. Students will be given an overview of Israeli foreign policy and Palestinian attempts at global outreach since 1948 before the course moves on to explore the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various regions of the world. Course requirements include regular preparation and participation, facilitating/co-leading classroom discussions, ten brief response essays, and a final original research paper. Most research papers will focus on Palestinian or Israeli foreign relations with another country, or the role of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in another country or region's politics, either historically or today. While there is no fixed prerequisite for the course, students should either have some background in the politics and history of Israel or the Middle East or have previous studied another country or region that they plan to examine in their research) (This is not an introductory course on the conflict.
