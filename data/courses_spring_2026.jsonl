Contact Improvisation, an improvised duet form, explores partnering through many techniques including weight-sharing, counter balancing, momentum and stillness. We focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements. Movers shift direction, velocity, momentum and the quality of touch as they explore dancing together. In this course, dancers concentrate on how partnering with others enables them to feel sensations in their own body more acutely. All levels of movement experience--from none to some--can come experience the joy of improvising through contact!

The course introduces the basic steps, methods and strategies of the research process; problem identification, hypothesis development, literature review, research design and methodology, data management, data analysis, and scientific communication. Its aim is to help students design and develop a thoughtful, persuasive, and potentially fundable scientific research proposal that addresses a health concern. Students begin with a broad health topic that they would like to investigate and learn how to narrow it down into a specific and feasible research question; then they learn how to design a methodology to address the question. In addition to comprehending and developing the elements of a research project, students also learn the principles of ethical conduct of research, essentials of scientific writing, as well as presentation skills. Students also learn how to conduct a literature review, how to evaluate the literature, and how to use a reference management software.

Students who were on the BIOL 360L/NBB 301 wait list in Fall 2025 AND Spring 2026 graduating senior Biology majors who need to fulfill their upper-level lab requirement have priority for this class. Contact Barbara Shannon at barbara.shannon@emory.edu for permission. Through this course, you will learn basic computational and programming skills and apply them to the simulation and analysis of neural data. Course instructors will provide introductory lessons on basic coding in Python, which will be used throughout the course through collaborative, group-based lab tutorials. The focus of this course will be to use these in-lab tutorials to understand how neuroscience data is structured, analyzed, simulated, and interpreted. The course will be divided into 2 portions: (1) coding, running, and interpreting simulations of neural activity, and (2) understanding the analysis of neural data. The course consists of lectures, group lab tutorials, and individual homework assignments for each module. This course originates in the Biology Department, and it will count as an elective and upper-level laboratory credit for the Biology major. (This course does NOT COUNT as elective credit for the NBB major; the catalog description is incorrect.) Prerequisites: Biology 142/142L and Chemistry 202; pre- or co-requisite: Biology 360/NBB 301).

(In this course we will examine the underlying causes of human behavior and traits, focusing particularly on the use of quantitative genetic methods (i.e, twin and adoption studies) to disentangle genetic and environmental influences. We also will review molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes that underlie behavior. We will begin by reviewing the historical backdrop to behavior genetics, including a focus on Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, and Gregor Mendel. We will proceed to examine the use of twin and adoption studies to disentangle genetic and environmental influences, and the advantages of these methods over family studies. We will then review various molecular genetic methods for finding specific genes. We will end by exploring the results of quantitative and molecular genetic studies of various forms of psychopathology, personality, and behavior.

Because they can only exist in drawings, they are often referred to as \"paper architecture.\" But these unbuildable designs perform important roles that built ones cannot. Because they see beyond the limits of their time and circumstances, they are also known as ¿visionary architecture¿. They are free experiments, speculations, statements, illustrations, and critiques in the form of imaginary spaces. They transform design tools into unique means of analysis, thought, and representation. They explore different cultural, historical, socio-political, aesthetic, and critical dimensions of the built environment. They create unreal worlds that defy the limits of what ours can become. In this advanced studio, we will explore centuries of such incredible designs, and you will have the opportunity to create a visionary architecture of your own.

We will focus on the genre's flexibility and capacity to 1) communicate individual experiences as they relate to powerful, painful, and liberating social, political, and historical events and 2) communicate the complexity of these experiences not just through writing but across different media including graphic novels, photography, film, music, interviews, and social media.

(Same as AFS 389 5) FREN 391R: Interdisciplinary Arts as Healing Practice (Prof. Montlouis-Gabriel / Tuesdays/Thursdays 10:00-11:15AM). Content: As Fabienne Kanor reflects in an interview: \"J'ai mal à mon histoire et la réécrire est le seul moyen que j'ai trouvé pour guérir un peu\" (\"My history hurts me, and rewriting it is the only way I have found to heal a little\"). This course takes up Kanor's insight as its guiding principle, exploring how artistic creation becomes a pathway to healing from historical trauma. How do artists transform pain into power? How can creativity help us heal from historical trauma and imagine new possibilities? This course invites you to explore how predominantly Black women artists and artists featuring Black women characters across the francophone world (from Senegal to Martinique, France to Vietnam, Cameroon to Reunion Island) use film, literature, poetry, performance, and visual arts as tools for healing and resistance. Through hands-on creative projects and rigorous literary and cultural analysis, you'll develop your own practice while learning concepts like \"cartographies of memory\" and \"aquatic metaphors\" as ways to understand healing journeys across the diasporas. You'll collaborate with visiting artist TIE on her project \"Odyssey in Black Utero,\" exploring how art creates healing pathways between past and future. Your final project? Create your own \"map to elsewhere\" a creative work that visualizes connections between historical memory and imagined futures. No prior art experience necessary: just curiosity and openness to creative exploration. Texts may include: Fabienne Kanor, Humus (excerpts) Léonora Miano, La saison de lOmbre Nadia Chonville, Mon coeur bat vite Maryse Condé, Moi, Tituba sorcière de Salem (excerpts) Alice Diop, Saint-Omer (film) Mati Diop, Atlantics (film) Alain Gomis, Félicité (film) Jean-Pierre Bekolo, Les Saignantes (film) Eva Doumbia, Autophagies (Theater) TIE, Odyssey in Black Utero (collaborative project)"}

FREN 488. Hauntings: Literature, Psychoanalysis, Film Prof. Claire Nouvet / Mondays and Wednesdays, 1:00-2:15PM. Content: With the study of hysteria, Freud discovered the process of repression and elaborated the concept of the unconscious. The unconscious, however, does not rest quietly. It returns to haunt the present through various disruptions that conscious thought does not know how to explain to itself: slips of the tongue, dreams, phobias, anxieties, delusions. If we learn from psychoanalysis that a past that has been repressed can return to disrupt the present, literature, for its part, has its own way of staging these uncanny returns. What comes back under the figures of the ghosts, vampires, and witches that haunt the literary stage? How do traumatic histories haunt the next generations? And what happens to those who incarnate past histories that the present prefers to forget? These are some of the questions that we will address at the juncture of literature, psychoanalysis and film. Special attention will be given to the way psychoanalysis addresses the issue of trauma not only at the individual level but also at the collective level: transgenerational transmission of historical traumas.

But when we approach the law historically, we see it as a process that changed over time under pressure from a range of forces: political, economic, social, and cultural; national, regional, and global; and driven by elites and people on the ground. The course is structured into three distinct units. Unit 1 addresses foundational inquiries pertaining to legal history. The objective of this unit is to establish a conceptual framework for analyzing law and legal orders in global perspective. Unit 2 investigates the interactions of law, society, and economy in a particular place and time, with emphasis on specific themes. Students will work with secondary literature, case studies, and primary sources. The content of Unit 2 varies, according to the research specialization and interests of the faculty member teaching the course. Unit 3 requires students to apply what they learned in Units 1 and 2 in a hands-on group project. In this iteration of HIST 210, taught by Professor Chris Suh, Unit 2 will focus on the topics of citizenship, civil rights, and precarity in the United States from the late 19th century to the present. Case studies will focus on Asian Americans' experiences with the law."}

Class meetings will consist of a combination of lectures and in-class computational exercises. Prerequisites: Biology 142 + 142L. Although the class will be largely self-contained, a working knowledge of introductory calculus, statistics, linear algebra, and some exposure to differential equations will be helpful (although a mathematical review will be provided). Knowing some neuroscience may also be helpful, but it is not required. Although most of the course will be taught in Matlab, only a working knowledge of basic programming control structures (e.g., for/while loops & if/then structures, etc.) is necessary, as we will devote time to coding tutorials at the beginning of the semester. If you have some coding experience but have learned R or C or Java or python, you should be fine. (This course is also taught as IBS 534.)"}

How might a short story that takes place over the course of an hour give every detail heightened significance? In addition to exploring the narrative pressures of different timeframes, we will look at stories that break linearity, gesturing toward the future and even using elements like time travel to negotiate the constraints of the short story form.

As we try out various forms ourselves, we will situate our own poetic experiments in a centuries-long conversation extending to our present moment. Permission of the department required."}

Students will strive for excellence and excitement in the regular composition and revision of new poems, as well as an ever-broadening sense of the possibilities of our art. In addition to posting poems for workshop, students will provide context for their creative work, sharing influential texts and ideas, in order to deepen the class's collective ability to understand where their poems are coming from, and where they might be headed. Readings will include full-length poetry collections and essays on craft. Each student will be responsible for guiding discussion of one book (with a partner), and attendance at all Creative Writing Reading Series events is required.

No pre-requisite. This class is NOT open to first-year students. If journalism has historically been considered a pure and ethically-driven form of nonfiction; if, pardon the cliché, it is the first rough draft of history; if its principle motivator in this nation's history has been the pursuit of truth, justice and the American way (you did know Superman/Clark Kent was a newspaper reporter, right?); and if it is the most zealous guardian of not just any amendment to the U.S. Constitution but the First Amendment, then why is the profession of journalism historically misrepresented as crude and corrupt when Hollywood tries to tell its story? Or is the profession's purity just an old former newspaperman's misguided fantasy that confuses vice and virtue in a vocation that consumed him and his conscience for more than 35 years? Newsrooms have long been filled with quiet creative geniuses and loudmouth miscreants, the brilliant and the boorish, the talented and the tawdry, and yet there are few if any professions as tethered to, and as cognizant of, a code of ethics. What does that get you? Good fodder for screenwriters and filmmakers of feature films and documentaries at home and abroad. We'll dive into this history and have some lively assignments and discussions. Permission of the department required."}

The fertilized egg, a single cell, gives rise to many cells that form complex multicellular organisms with many different cell types, tissues, and organs. The overall goal of developmental biology is to elucidate the cellular and molecular processes that control this amazing achievement. The study of development spans molecular biology, cell biology, genetics, embryology, and importantly, evolution. These perspectives will be used to explore general principals and fundamental mechanisms that are shared between many diverse organisms, focusing on invertebrate and vertebrate animals. This includes consideration of human development with examples of medically relevant disorders and social and ethical questions related to the field. This course fulfills the Column A requirement (or elective credit) for the Biology major. Prerequisites: Biology 142 + 142L."}

Students will become familiar with major sociological, anthropological and hermeneutic approaches which pursue questions about the function, origin, comparison and language of religion. We will explore key terms in the contemporary study of religion such as culture, body, performance, rationality. Throughout, we will be concerned with the ways in which the category of religion has been and continues to be constructed by those who study it. This class is designed to increase students' methodological self-awareness as scholars of religion."}

Seminar on sociological aspects of Apollo space era (1961-1972), focusing on social and cultural aspects of four new realities: \"Spaceflight,\" \"Astronaut,\" \"Astronaut Family,\" and \"NASA.\" Students use primary source material from the Stuart A. Rose Library and the Apollo 15 Learning Hub to create final projects. Class Notes Only 12 humans have walked on the Moon; only 24 have orbited the Moon. No human has been beyond Earth's orbit since the last Apollo lunar mission in 1972. The Apollo missions were extraordinary scientific achievements; they were also historical events located in particular social contexts. This seminar course takes a sociological approach to explore the Apollo era (1961-1972), focusing on four main areas: \"Spaceflight\" \"Astronaut,\" \"Astronaut Family,\" and \"NASA.\" We will begin with brief background on the political, technological, and broader social contexts of the time. Then we will delve deeper into various social and cultural aspects of these four new realities: \"Spaceflight\" (e.g., media constructions and projections), \"Astronaut\" (e.g., links to test pilot culture; gendered construction of a new occupation), \"Astronaut Family\" (e.g., relationship with the press; the unpaid work roles of wives; creating new NASA communities) and \"NASA\" (e.g., PR efforts and image constructions; early organizational culture). Students will work with primary source material from the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript and Rare Book Library, the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship's Apollo 15 Learning Hub as well as other digital archival material (from data collected by Professor Scott) to create their own projects on one of the main topic areas. Requirements: Three short research assignments that will build into a final project, in the form of an op-ed article. Drafts of the final project will be peer reviewed and discussed in class. Class attendance and discussion are integral to this course. Prerequisite: one Sociology course."}

Muslims were variously persecuted, wooed, assimilated, tolerated, forcibly converted, protected, \"ignored,\" \"modernized,\" socialized and granted independence and autonomy by various incarnations of the Russian state. Topics such as the conquest of Kazan and the steppe, the establishment of state-controlled Islam, the colonization of the North Caucasus and Central Asia, the shock of war and revolution, forced secularization, the late Soviet rise of a political Islam, and post-Soviet political Islam will all be discussed.

This class begins with an overview of genetics and evolutionary theory, providing a foundation for the rest of the course. Then we use this knowledge to explore examples of adaptation and microevolution among modern humans and to address misconceptions about human variation. Next, we will turn to macroevolution of our species, Homo sapiens, using comparative and paleoanthropological approaches. With the comparative approach, we focus on anatomy and behavior of living non-human primates to identify traits we share with them and traits that are uniquely human. Paleoanthropology combines our knowledge of living primates with observations from the fossil record to trace the evolution of primates and hominins (humans and their ancestors) over millions of years. Therefore, we will gain insight into our own evolutionary past and attempt to identify where, when, why, and how our biological and cultural traits emerged.

We then develop the theory of individual choice and rationality, examining orderings, preference relations, maximality, acyclicity, and rational choice functions, along with Sen's conditions ( and ß) and Houthakker's Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference. Building on this foundation, the course turns to social aggregation mechanisms, including classical voting rules, their axiomatic characterizations (e.g., May's Theorem, Black's Theorem), and the challenges posed by Arrow's axioms and his celebrated impossibility theorem. We also study issues of manipulation, strategy-proofness, and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem. The course concludes with broader normative debates, including Sen's impossibility of a Paretian liberal and Gibbard's theory of alienable rights. Throughout, students will engage both with formal proofs and with the philosophical and institutional implications of the results, making the course suitable for students in political science, philosophy, and economics who are interested in the logic and limits of collective decision-making. Prerequisites: Some prior exposure to formal methods (logic, mathematics, or microeconomic theory) is recommended."}

Students will learn about the linguistics characteristics of the different Spanish varieties spoken by these communities, including phonetic, morphological, syntactic and lexical aspects. Special attention is given to the relationship between language and society, particularly on topics such as ethnic and cultural identity, multilingualism and language policy. The course also presents a theoretical and practical approach to the ethnographic research method. Students will read and analyze studies carried out by different scholars and will design their own research project on the topic of their preference. Special attention is given to ethical principles, for this reason students will need to complete the web-based Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) Program in the Protection of Human Subjects in Research. Background on general Linguistics is recommended, such as the one provided in Span/Ling 303, Span/Ling 304 or Ling 201.This course meets the sociocultural requirement of the Linguistics Major and can be used as one of the required 400-level courses for the Joint Major in Spanish & Linguistics or for the Major/Minor in Spanish. TEXTS: - Escobar, Anna María and Kim Potowski. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. - Selection of articles available in Canvas. EVALUATION: Evaluation will be based in class participation, weekly assignments, one exam, one research project and five written practices. PRE-REQUISITES: One foundational course, preferably SPAN/LING 303 or SPAN/LING 304."}

It will be assumed that students are already familiar with the goals of linguistic inquiry and the methods of basic syntactic analysis (trees, categories, constituency tests). If you have not taken Foundations of Linguistics (LING-201/ANT-203), or an equivalent course, you will be required to do significant extra self-instructional work at the beginning of the semester. What we do in this course: Much of the language you hear over the course of a day consists of sentences you have never heard before, and yet you are able to understand them. How is this possible? The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a sentence is determined by the meanings of its words and the way they are combined. In the first part of this course, students will learn a system for doing just this - combining phrase structure trees and computing the meanings that result, using the formal language of predicate logic to represent sentence meanings. Then, in the second part of the course, we'll focus on utterance meaning - aspects of meaning that go beyond what is shown in the predicate logic. For example, what enables us to understand a sentence like `There's ice cream on your shirt' as a simple informative description in some contexts, as an accusation in others, and as a warning in still others? We'll discuss speech acts, implicature, presupposition and other aspects of utterance meaning as we explore the close relationship between semantics and pragmatics. All required readings will be made available online."}

Your goal will be to synthesize the work you've done as a writer and learner at Emory - within the minor, and beyond - by curating and showcasing what you consider your best work. As you grapple with how to portray a version of yourself and the commitments you've developed from your experiences, we will take a metadisciplinary and rhetorical approach to this representation. We will reflect on how you have learned to create meaning in your fields and communities, in terms of what you have been taught to value and come to value personally in your scholarship. Moreover, you will practice using writing and speech to show this approach to others who may or may not have the same backgrounds as you do. The course will culminate in an oral \"defense\" of your portfolio, where you will present what you've created to me, your peers, and others in the Writing Program.

As part of this, we will compare typical pronunciations of Spanish with those of English, and we will examine how different communities assign different social meanings and values to different pronunciations (for instance, why and in what circumstances do people value positively or negatively pronunciations such as \"ello están contento\" as opposed to \"ellos están contentos\"). This semester, we will include a component focusing on how different pronunciations and intonation can contribute to the performance of literary, theatrical and other spoken-language texts/events. TEXT: Tuten, D. N., Tejedo-Herrero, L. F., R. Rao, & H. R. Clarke. 2022. Pronunciaciones del español (Routledge). PARTICULARS: This course is designed for a wide variety of students, including those for whom Spanish is a primary/native or heritage language as well as for those who are learning Spanish as a second language. This is an introductory course in Hispanic Linguistics and therefore no background in Linguistics is required. Span/Ling 303 is a core course for the Spanish and Linguistics Joint Major and a Foundational Course for the Spanish Major and Minor. It counts as an elective or HAL course for other Linguistics majors and minors. EVALUATION is based on attendance/participation, homework assignments, exams, and performance projects. PREREQUISITE: SPAN 212 or an Official Spanish Placement into our Foundational Course level (Span 300-318). Take the online Spanish Placement Exam at http://spanport.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/placement/index.html. For more information on Foundational Courses, please go to www.spanport.emory.edu."}

Empasis would be on using models in population biology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, with particular consideration of bacteria, bacteriophage, and antibiotic treatment, as well as the practical (medical and epidemiological) application of the concepts of population and evolutionary biology. Models about the age and distribution of cancer will also be looked at. Students in this course will learn how to prepare a manuscript and will submit the manuscript to a journal, as co-authors. The class will learn how to use the Berkely Madonna software for the numerical solution to differential equations and Monte Carlo simulations.
