To this end, Span 201 aims to help students - continue to learn to use Spanish to communicate via active (speaking and writing) and passive modes (listening and reading); - further develop their knowledge of and about the tools of communication: basic linguistic units (words, idioms, conjugations, sounds) and grammar (rules which permit you to combine the units meaningfully); - explore, appreciate, and reflect upon a variety of Hispanic/ Latin/ Latinx cultures to critically discuss, compare, and analyze cultural productions. REQUIRED PROGRAM: Contraseña: Your Passport to Foundational Spanish (LingroLearning), a completely mobile and digital immersive experience. PARTICULARS: Classes are conducted in Spanish, and daily attendance and active engagement are expected.
